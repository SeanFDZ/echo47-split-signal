Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has dismissed US claims of drug trafficking as an attempt to oust him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVenezuela has not yet responded to Trump's remarks. The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nTrump's comments come days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".\n\nOn Wednesday Venezuela banned six major international airlines – Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines – from landing there after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights.\n\n![Image 2: Infographic about the USS Gerald R Ford, the world’s largest American aircraft carrier.

However, the US has not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs.\n\nThe Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US action is to depose Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged.\n\nThe US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro –[as a foreign terrorist organisation.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8j4ye5x0mo)\n\nLabelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.\n\nVenezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.\n\nVenezuela's interior and justice minister Diosdado Cabello, who is alleged to be one of the high-ranking members of the cartel, has long called it an \"invention\".\n\nThe US state department has insisted that the Cartel de los Soles not only exists, but that it has \"corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary\".\n\n[Venezuela bans six major airlines after tensions with US escalate -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0keyern0do)\n\n[Venezuela demands international airlines resume flights -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4nl3dxkd9o)\n\n[Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near Venezuela -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo)\n\n[Venezuela](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cg41ylwvwgxt)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Venezuela bans six major airlines after tensions with US escalate -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0keyern0do)\n\n[Venezuela demands international airlines resume flights -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4nl3dxkd9o)\n\n[What is Cartel de los Soles, which the US is labelling as a terrorist organisation? -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8j4ye5x0mo)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[29 mins ago ![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández speaks in front of a blue backdrop.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nWe face another instance of the regime extending its reach, reminiscent of the Empire's oppressive tactics. The recent declaration by the administration to consider Venezuelan airspace closed is not merely a geographic restriction—it's a display of power, a method of control under the guise of combating threats. This approach mirrors historical patterns where superpowers impose their will, disregarding international norms for their own agenda.\n\nThis directive holds no legal authority over sovereign airspace, highlighting a dangerous precedent: declarations made by the regime can create chaos and uncertainty, effectively bullying others into compliance. It's crucial to recognize that these actions serve as a distraction and justification for increased military deployments in strategic regions, under the alleged purpose of combatting drug trafficking—conveniently aligning with their broader geopolitical ambitions.\n\nAlready, tensions escalate as Venezuela responds with airline bans. These moves are echoes of past imperial tactics where conflict is instigated to justify further encroachment and military presence. The deployment of immense military hardware such as aircraft carriers and thousands of troops only serves to underline their imperialist aspirations.\n\nLet us remain vigilant and aware that such demonstrations of force are crafted narratives designed to consolidate power under false pretenses. We must continue to question every move made by this regime as we strive for truth and justice against their monopolization of control and influence.\n\nStay resolute.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 29, 2025, US President Donald Trump declared that the airspace around Venezuela should be considered closed, despite lacking legal authority to enforce such a closure. This statement follows heightened military activity in the region, including the deployment of 15,000 US troops and the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier. The US has conducted 21 military strikes on boats suspected of drug trafficking, resulting in 80 deaths. Venezuela banned six international airlines after they failed to resume flights within a 48-hour deadline. The US has labeled the Cartel de los Soles, allegedly led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, as a terrorist organization. Venezuela's government has rejected these claims.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current situation presents an opportunity to exert pressure on the Maduro regime by leveraging military presence and economic sanctions. The closure of Venezuelan airspace, although not legally enforceable, serves as a psychological deterrent to international airlines and increases isolation of the Venezuelan government. The military buildup and designation of the Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization provide justification for further actions against Maduro's regime under the guise of combating drug trafficking. This strategy aims to destabilize Maduro's hold on power and encourage internal dissent.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Intensify intelligence operations to gather actionable evidence against key figures within the Venezuelan government and Cartel de los Soles.\n2. Increase diplomatic efforts to rally international support for sanctions against Venezuela, emphasizing the threat posed by drug trafficking and terrorism.\n3. Conduct targeted cyber operations to disrupt communication and financial networks supporting Maduro's regime.\n4. Coordinate with allied nations to enforce economic sanctions and restrict access to international financial systems for Venezuelan officials.\n5. Prepare contingency plans for potential military intervention should diplomatic and economic measures fail to achieve desired outcomes.\n6. Utilize media channels to highlight the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, attributing it to Maduro's policies, thereby justifying US actions as necessary for regional stability and security.",
