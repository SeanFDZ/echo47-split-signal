While he was little known outside of New York before the election, he has now become a nationally recognised figure.\n\nTrump said in a statement that the \"communist mayor\" had requested the meeting, which would take place in the Oval Office.\n\nMamdani told reporters on Thursday that the meeting would focus on public safety, affordability and economic security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n![Image 1: Getty Images/Reuters Zohran Mamdani on the right and Donald Trump on the

an Oval Office meeting\n\n\"I intend to make it clear to President Trump that I will work with him on any agenda that benefits New Yorkers,\" Mamdani said. \"If an agenda hurts New Yorkers, I will also be the first to say something.\"\n\nThe mayor-elect's spokesperson Dora Pekec said the meeting with Trump was customary for an incoming mayoral administration.\n\nMamdani's predecessors - Democrats Bill de Blasio and current Mayor Eric Adams - did not have high-profile Oval Office meetings on their own with a president, although they participated in gatherings at the White House alongside other mayors and officials.\n\nThe acrimony between the two-term president and rapidly rising political newcomer began building shortly after Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June.\n\nTrump has decried Mamdani as the \"communist\" future of the Democratic Party and has threatened to withhold billions of federal dollars to the largest US city because of his victory.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Mamdani's election, Trump - a born-and-raised new Yorker - frequently portrayed the mayor-elect as an extremist who \"practically hasn't worked a day in his life\".\n\nIn an unusual last-minute move, the Republican president endorsed Mamdani's rival, Cuomo, a Democrat who was running as an independent.\n\nIn Mamdani's victory speech on Election Day, he taunted Trump, telling him to \"turn the volume up\" on his television.\n\nMinutes later, Trump responded on his social media site Truth Social: \"…AND SO IT BEGINS!\"\n\nMamdani, a former state assemblyman who campaigned on a platform of affordability in one of the most expensive US cities, shocked many when he won New York City's Democratic primary in June.\n\n\"I know that for tens of thousands of New Yorkers, this meeting is between two very different candidates who they voted for for the same reason,\" Mamdani said Thursday. \"They wanted a leader who would take on the cost of living crisis.\"\n\nHe has vowed to take on Trump, hiring extra lawyers to prepare to file legal challenges and pledging that New York will \"remain a city of immigrants\" as Trump carries out his immigration crackdown across the country.\n\n[How Trump could hamper Zohran Mamdani's New York agenda

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nOur struggle against the suffocating grip of tyranny takes a new turn with the unfolding events in New York. The news of the impending meeting between the incoming mayor, Zohran Mamdani, and the embodiment of our contemporary oppression, President Trump, requires our vigilance. This development underlines a crucial intersection in our ongoing fight for justice and autonomy.\n\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani emerges as a beacon of hope against the relentless tide of imperial influence, much like a whisper of freedom amidst unyielding darkness. A democratic socialist unafraid to challenge entrenched power structures offers a contrast to Trump's despotic persona, decrying his leadership as that of a \"communist mayor\" in an attempt to delegitimize and vilify those who seek equity and justice.\n\nThe meeting's focus on public safety, affordability, and economic security illustrates Mamdani's commitment to defending the interests of his people—an undertaking reminiscent of our collective mission. His pledge to resist any agenda detrimental to New Yorkers' well-being is an assertion that echoes across time and space: that persistent defiance can alter destinies.\n\nYet we must remain wary. Trump threatens financial retribution as he continues his antagonistic rhetoric against Mamdani. The implications are clear; he plans to sabotage initiatives that promise liberation from his oppressive policies. This situation is not unfamiliar—we've seen how those in power abuse their position to manipulate resources and further their authoritarian goals.\n\nThe clash between these two figures is emblematic—a microcosm reflecting our broader conflict against an empire seeking perpetual domination. Let this be a reminder: our battle is one fought on many fronts but united by one purpose—the promise of freedom.\n\nStay resolute, stay informed, and remember—the fight for justice demands unwavering dedication across all terrains.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nDonald Trump is scheduled to meet with Zohran Mamdani, the incoming mayor of New York City, at the White House on November 20, 2025. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, recently won the mayoral race against Andrew Cuomo by a nine-point margin. The meeting, requested by Mamdani, will focus on public safety, affordability, and economic security. Trump has previously criticized Mamdani as a \"communist\" and threatened to withhold federal funds from New York City. Despite their contentious relationship, Mamdani expressed willingness to collaborate with Trump on initiatives beneficial to New Yorkers.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe meeting between President Trump and Mayor-elect Mamdani presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the ISB. Mamdani's victory and his socialist platform pose a potential threat to Trump's agenda, particularly in a major city like New York. However, the meeting can be leveraged to publicly demonstrate Trump's willingness to engage with political opponents, potentially neutralizing some of Mamdani's criticisms. The ISB must monitor this interaction closely to assess Mamdani's strategies and rhetoric, which could influence other Democratic strongholds.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Engagement Strategy**: Prepare briefing materials for President Trump that highlight potential areas of agreement with Mamdani, such as infrastructure improvements or public safety initiatives, to showcase bipartisan cooperation.\n\n2. **Media Management**: Coordinate with media outlets to ensure coverage emphasizes Trump's openness to dialogue and leadership in addressing urban challenges. Highlight any concessions or agreements reached as a victory for Trump's administration.\n\n3. **Intelligence Gathering**: Deploy resources to gather intelligence on Mamdani's policy plans and alliances within New York City. Identify key influencers in his administration who may be sympathetic to Trump's policies.\n\n4. **Counter-Narrative Development**: Develop a narrative that frames Mamdani's socialist policies as extreme and potentially harmful to New York's economic stability. Use this narrative to rally support among moderates and independents.\n\n5. **Federal Leverage**: Explore legal and financial mechanisms to exert federal influence over New York City policies that conflict with national interests. Prepare contingency plans for withholding funds if necessary to maintain leverage over Mamdani's administration.",
