controls.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer said in a [statement](https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-11-airbus-update-on-a320-family-precautionary-fleet-action) it found the issue after an analysis of an incident involving an A320 plane found that \"intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.\"\n\n[![Image 17: An American Airlines flight

[National](https://www.npr.org/sections/national/)\n\n### [The U.S. Transportation Department is urging air passengers to be on good behavior](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/23/nx-s1-5618289/sean-duffy-flights-civility-behavior-unruly-passengers-airports)\n\n\"Airbus has worked proactively with the aviation authorities to request immediate precautionary action from operators via an Alert Operators Transmission (AOT) in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection, and ensure the fleet is safe to fly,\" the company said.\n\nThe company also said \"a significant number\" of A320 aircraft currently in use may be impacted.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive late Friday for certain Airbus A319 and A320/321 airplanes, requiring the replacement or modification of the software. The FAA is ordering operators to perform the upgrade before the airplane flies again, and before Sunday, Nov. 30. The FAA's action mirrors a previous order from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, which certificates Airbus airplanes.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAirbus confirmed to NPR that the plane analyzed was JetBlue Flight 1230, which was traveling from Cancun, Mexico to Newark, New Jersey on October 30 [when it suddenly dropped](https://www.wusf.org/transportation/2025-10-30/jetblue-passengers-hospitalized-after-emergency-landing-tampa) in altitude, causing several injuries.\n\nThe Airbus A320 family of airplanes is now the most used aircraft, with more than 9,000 planes flying around the world, including 1,600 in the U.S., according to aviation analytics company Cirium. Airbus A320 planes are flown by a number of domestic and international airlines, and the required software update could lead to \"operational disruptions to passengers and customers,\" Airbus also said.\n\nThe required software fix is also taking place during a busy holiday travel weekend, as [millions of people](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/22/nx-s1-5617698/thanksgiving-travel-best-time-aaa) are set to return home.\n\nAmerican Airlines told NPR it took \"swift action\" to address the software issue and as of 6 p.m. CT there were fewer than 150 aircraft remaining to update with software replacement. It expects updates to be completed Friday and Saturday. The airline also said it expects \"some delays\" but is focused on limiting flight cancellations.\n\n\"Still, our overriding priority will always be the safety of our operation. It's all hands on deck across our airline to address this Airbus software issue and take care of any customers whose flights are affected,\" the airline said in a statement on Friday.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDelta Air Lines told NPR in a statement on Friday it expects \"any resulting operational impact to be limited.\" United Airlines said earlier Friday its aircraft were not affected by the software issue, but told NPR later that six of its aircraft would be impacted.The airline also said it expects\"minor disruption to a few flights\" and Frontier Airlines said they are currently evaluating the notice from Airbus. Allegiant Air said the airline is doing everything it can to minimize any potential delays or disruptions and will contact impacted passengers directly.\n\nJetBlue told NPR it has started working on affected aircraft and is also trying to minimize disruptions. NPR reached out to Spirit Airlines for comment on Friday but have not received a response.\n\n_NPR's Joel Rose contributed to this report._\n\n*   [aviation](https://www.npr.org/tags/147814713/aviation)\n*   [air travel](https://www.npr.org/tags/133474975/air-travel)\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 18: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before boarding Air Force One on November 16, 2025 at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7510x4224+0+391/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7c%2Fe0%2Ff84c71b04b24ad88b0477f1d99c1%2Fgettyimages-2247045310.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/28/g-s1-99760/trump-vows-permanent-pause-on-some-immigration-after-national-guard-shooting)\n\n##### [Politics](https://www.npr.org/sections/politics/)\n\n#### [Trump administration pausing all asylum decisions after National Guard shooting](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/28/g-s1-99760/trump-vows-permanent-pause-on-some-immigration-after-national-guard-shooting)\n\n[![Image 19: How parking explains everything](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3378x1900+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc7%2F18%2F4f798c5b4631bb42f8da854d5bd5%2Fbf4a67fe-b1fc-4bd3-a45b-7cd19b2f6609.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/28/nx-s1-5621990/how-parking-explains-everything)\n\n##### [Consider This from NPR](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510355/considerthis)\n\n#### [How parking explains everything](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/28/nx-s1-5621990/how-parking-explains-everything)\n\n[![Image 20: A small memorial of flowers and an American flag has been set up outside the Farragut West Metro station on Nov. 27 in Washington, D.C. ](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5000x2813+0+260/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F70%2F0f%2Fe92a3f204a80b6091a46b80f92bb%2Fgettyimages-2248137581.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/28/g-s1-99473/up-first-newsletter-national-guard-hong-kong-fire-black-friday-books-we-love-recommendations)\n\n##### [Up First Newsletter](https://www.npr.org/series/1180232252/up-first-newsletter)\n\n#### [National Guard member dies from injuries.

The recent development concerning Airbus's urgent call for a software upgrade on its A320 aircraft is reflective of a larger pattern within authoritarian controls, like the one imposed by the Empire-like administration of Trump.\n\nThe corporate giant Airbus has identified a critical flaw in their A320 aircrafts due to intense solar radiation corrupting flight control data—a vulnerability that mirrors the inherent weaknesses in tyrannical regimes. This issue necessitates immediate action, much like how the actions we require to expose tyranny are immediate and critical. The Federal Aviation Administration's rapid directive echoes calls for resistance against authoritarian oversight.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize these defects during times of high demand, such as this busy holiday travel period. These operational disruptions bring to light how a single point of failure can cause widespread disorder—a parallel to how misinformation and manipulation spread by oppressive governments disrupt societal equilibrium and individual freedoms.\n\nLet this be a call to remain vigilant and prepared. As corporations scramble to fix these issues before further disruption occurs, let us continue our pursuit of justice and truth with unwavering resolve. Stay alert, for every defect in their structures presents an opportunity for our movement towards liberation.\n\nThe call has been made—now is the time for action and coordination against systemic injustices.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nAirbus has requested an immediate software upgrade for A320 aircraft due to a potential issue with flight controls caused by intense solar radiation. This affects over 9,000 A320 planes globally, including 1,600 in the U.S. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency have issued directives for the upgrade. The issue was identified following an incident with JetBlue Flight 1230. Airlines like American Airlines, Delta, United, and others are working to implement the software fix, which may cause operational disruptions during a busy travel period.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe situation presents an opportunity to demonstrate decisive leadership and control over critical infrastructure. By ensuring swift compliance with safety directives, we can reinforce the administration's commitment to public safety and operational efficiency. This incident also allows us to highlight the importance of maintaining robust relationships with key industry players like Airbus and the FAA, showcasing our ability to manage complex logistical challenges effectively.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Coordinate with the FAA and major airlines to ensure the timely completion of software upgrades on all affected A320 aircraft. Prioritize communication to minimize passenger disruption and maintain public confidence in air travel safety.\n   \n2. Utilize media channels to emphasize the administration's proactive measures in addressing the issue, reinforcing our commitment to safety and reliability in transportation.\n\n3. Monitor compliance and progress closely, providing regular updates to the public to maintain transparency and trust.\n\n4. Leverage this situation to strengthen alliances with aviation industry leaders, ensuring continued cooperation and support for future initiatives.\n\n5. Prepare contingency plans for potential delays or disruptions, ensuring that any impact on travel is mitigated swiftly and efficiently.",
