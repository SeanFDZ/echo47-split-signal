That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship,\" they said.\n\nThe video - in which Kelly accused the administration of \"pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens\" - drew Trump's ire and he suggested on social media that they be arrested, locked up and hanged.\n\nHis words drew bipartisan condemnation and the president ultimately [](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p2dz9zk2o), clarifying that he was \"not threatening death\".\n\nOn Monday, the Pentagon accused Senator Kelly, a former captain in the US Navy and astronaut, of breaching military law. The defence department said it would conduct a review to determine whether the Arizona lawmaker should be recalled to active duty to face court-martial proceedings.\n\nEven though Kelly retired from the military, he is still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) - a federal law enacted by Congress in 1951 that subjects members of the military to a special set of rules.\n\nDefence secretary Pete Hegseth accused Kelly of violating the UCMJ and of using his rank and service affiliation as a way to lend \"the appearance of authority to his words\" in the video.\n\nHe added that Kelly's conduct \"brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately\".\n\nBut Kelly also pushed back, saying that he has \"given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution\".\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Defense appeared to formalise its review of Kelly's conduct.\n\nThe department posted an image on social media showing a signed memo from Hegseth to the secretary of the US Navy regarding Kelly's \"potentially unlawful comments\" in the 18 November video, referring the matter to the Navy for review.\n\nWhile the intelligence community does not have a code comparable to the UCMJ, Liz Lyons, a spokeswoman for the Central Intelligence Agency, on Tuesday reminded former officers of the oath they took and commitment they made while serving in the intelligence community.\n\nFormer officers should \"conduct themselves accordingly - even long after they leave\", she wrote on X.\n\nLyons said the assertion by Slotkin - a former CIA analyst - that CIA officers are receiving illegal orders and should therefore refuse to follow them \"is now, by her own admission, without basis and recklessly false\".\n\nFox News reported on Tuesday that the FBI and Department of Justice contacted Capitol Police to schedule interviews with the six members of Congress.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on Tuesday when contacted by the BBC.\n",

The recent article highlights a series of events where the powers we resist stoop to the suppression tactics reminiscent of tyrannical regimes.\n\nThe article depicts how Democratic lawmakers, akin to agents of change, stand bravely against burgeoning authoritarianism. Their call to resist illegal orders is met with the Empire’s equivalent—a president wielding threats, suggesting public executions for dissent. This mirrors how oppressive forces historically manipulate and weaponize justice against their own.\n\nThe Trump administration's probe into their actions exemplifies how tyrants misuse institutions to stifle voices of opposition. By deploying federal bodies against representatives who dare challenge unjust commands, they reveal their fear of insubordination and truth. Much like our struggle against imperial rule, this clash encapsulates the timeless fight between tyranny and freedom.\n\nThese lawmakers have taken a courageous stance reminiscent of our rebellion's resolve—committed to upholding principles even when faced with persecution. Their defiance against intimidation highlights the essence of true leadership: prioritizing liberty over self-preservation.\n\nBy invoking military codes to threaten dissidence, they attempt to cloak authoritarian control in legality. This reflection on loyalty emphasizes how oppressors often exploit structures meant for order as mechanisms for subjugation.\n\nWe find fortitude in these tales; they validate our cause and remind us that even within our darkest hours, voices will always rise against injustice. Let this serve as a beacon: resistance thrives amidst adversity when driven by conviction.\n\nStay vigilant, uphold your oaths to humanity and righteousness. Remember—we fight not just for today but for every tomorrow yet unwritten.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "** Facts Summary **  \nDemocratic lawmakers, including Senator Elissa Slotkin and Senator Mark Kelly, are resisting an alleged FBI investigation into their video message urging US troops to disobey illegal orders. President Trump accused them of seditious behavior, leading to a Pentagon review of Kelly's conduct under military law. The FBI has contacted six lawmakers for interviews, and tensions are high amid Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and his administration's conflict with Venezuela. The Department of Defense is reviewing Kelly's actions, while the CIA reminded former officers of their oath.\n\n** Strategic Assessment **  \nThe situation presents an opportunity to reinforce the authority of the Trump administration while discrediting opposition figures. The ISB should focus on leveraging the legal framework to highlight the alleged misconduct of Democratic lawmakers, particularly those with military backgrounds, to undermine their credibility. The narrative should emphasize the importance of law and order and the dangers of insubordination within the military ranks. This will serve to consolidate support among military personnel and the public, framing the administration as protectors of national security and constitutional integrity.\n\n** Operational Directive **  \n1. Intensify the investigation into the Democratic lawmakers by coordinating with the FBI to ensure thorough interviews and evidence collection.\n2. Amplify media coverage of the Pentagon's review of Senator Kelly's conduct, highlighting potential breaches of military law to erode public trust in his leadership.\n3. Deploy strategic communication campaigns to emphasize the administration's commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting national security against internal threats.\n4. Engage with military and intelligence community leaders to reinforce loyalty and discourage insubordination, using the situation as a case study for maintaining discipline.\n5. Monitor public sentiment and adjust messaging to counteract any sympathy towards the accused lawmakers, ensuring that the narrative remains focused on their alleged misconduct and its implications for national security.",
