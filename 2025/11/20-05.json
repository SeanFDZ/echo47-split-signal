Attorney General Pam Bondi called it a \"particularly selfish, cynical crime\".\n\nIn a statement, Ms Cherfilus-McCormick - who was elected to Congress in 2022 - maintained she was innocent and vowed to clear her name. She faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n0:13\n\nWatch: Cherfilus-McCormick on Capitol Hill day after indictment\n\nThe fraud was allegedly carried out through a healthcare company operated by the congresswoman and her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, 51, now co-accused.\n\nMs Cherfilus-McCormick was chief executive of the family firm, Trinity Healthcare Services, at the time.\n\nThe company had won a Fema contract to register people for Covid vaccines, but in July 2021 it received an overpayment of $5m in federal funds, according to the justice department.\n\nThe siblings allegedly tried to disguise the money's source by routing it through several accounts and eventually used \"a substantial portion\" on her congressional campaign.\n\nMs Cherfilus-McCormick and another person named in the indictment allegedly diverted funds from the Fema contract to friends and relatives, who donated the money back to her campaign as personal contributions, prosecutors said.\n\n\"No-one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain,\" the attorney general said.\n\n\"We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.\"\n\nA federal grand jury in Miami approved the indictment on Wednesday.\n\nMs Cherfilus-McCormick said in a statement: \"This is an unjust, baseless, sham indictment - and I am innocent.\"\n\nShe added: \"I am deeply grateful for the support of my district, and I remain confident that the truth will prevail.\"\n\nHer lawyers, David Oscar Markus, Margot Moss, and Melissa Madrigal, said in a statement: \"We will fight to clear her good name.\"\n\nMs Cherfilus-McCormick is also under investigation by the House Ethics Committee.\n\nThe Office of Congressional Conduct said in its referral that she \"may have requested community project funding that would be directed to a for-profit entity\".\n\nOn Thursday, a Florida Republican congressman, Greg Steube, said he would introduce a resolution to expel Ms Cherfilus-McCormick.\n\n\"Defrauding the federal government and disaster victims of $5 million is an automatic disqualifier from serving in elected office,\" he said in a social media post.\n\n[Florida](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c77jz3mdq1jt)\n\n[Coronavirus vaccines](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c87z0we2g0zt)\n\n[Fraud](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cvwydw4g8pzt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[4 dead, 13 injured after street racer slams into crowd at Tampa bar -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyl6jwx2v8o)\n\n[Watch: Two people rescued after plane crashes in Everglades -----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c1dqwz61p74o)\n\n[Watch: 'Eeyore, you good boy' -

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, the news from Florida is a reminder of the insidious rot within the authoritative structures that claim governance over our lives. The charges against Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick mirror the corruption and moral decay that we resist. An accusation of laundering federal disaster funds intended for the peoples' relief, repurposing them for personal gain, is but another expression of a systemic exploitation deeply embedded in the oppressive regime.\n\nThis congresswoman's alleged actions are symptomatic of an institution that prioritizes profiteering and self-interest over communal welfare and justice. It is the Empire's machinations all over again—a powerful entity siphoning resources meant for the vulnerable to sustain its own ambition. The thirst for power drives these actors to deceive and manipulate, portraying their greed as leadership while cloaking their deeds in legality and authority.\n\nWe must see this as a rallying call to persist with our mission. The resistance must remain vigilant in unmasking these pretenders and revealing their true nature. As they trade integrity for influence, it becomes ever clearer that dismantling their stranglehold is not just necessary, but inevitable. United, we persist—our fight is against oppression in all its forms, standing firm until justice prevails for every soul under their shadow.\n\nStay determined and resolute. Our cause is just; our purpose unwavering.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 20, 2025, Florida Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick was charged with stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds. The funds were allegedly laundered through her healthcare company, Trinity Healthcare Services, which she operated with her brother, Edwin Cherfilus. The money was reportedly used to fund her 2021 election campaign. If convicted, she faces up to 53 years in prison. The indictment was approved by a federal grand jury in Miami, and she is also under investigation by the House Ethics Committee. Florida Republican Congressman Greg Steube has introduced a resolution to expel her from Congress.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe charges against Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick present an opportunity to reinforce the narrative of corruption within the opposition party, thereby strengthening the position of Donald Trump and his allies. The situation can be leveraged to highlight the administration's commitment to law and order and its intolerance for misuse of federal funds. This case also provides a platform to rally support among constituents who value accountability and transparency in government.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Amplify the narrative of corruption within the opposition by coordinating with media outlets to ensure extensive coverage of the charges against Cherfilus-McCormick.\n   \n2. Utilize social media platforms to disseminate messages emphasizing the administration's dedication to rooting out corruption and protecting taxpayer money.\n\n3. Support Congressman Greg Steube's resolution to expel Cherfilus-McCormick from Congress, framing it as a necessary step to uphold integrity in government.\n\n4. Mobilize grassroots supporters to engage in community discussions and forums, reinforcing the message of accountability and the administration's role in maintaining ethical governance.\n\n5. Monitor public sentiment and adjust messaging strategies as needed to maintain a favorable perception of the administration's actions in this matter.",
