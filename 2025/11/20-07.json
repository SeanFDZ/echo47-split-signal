He was 84.\n\nBush, a Republican, said in his eulogy: \"In a profession that attracts talkers, he was a thinker and a listener.\" Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, also attended.\n\nCheney was one of the most powerful vice-presidents in history, a key architect of Bush's \"war on terror\" after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and an early advocate of the invasion of Iraq.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1:14\n\nWatch: George W Bush honours former Vice President Dick Cheney\n\nIn Thursday's ceremony at Washington National Cathedral, Bush revealed that during the difficult 2004 re-election campaign, Cheney had offered to step off the ticket.\n\n\"I arrived at the conclusion they do not come any better than Dick Cheney,\" Bush told mourners.\n\nHe said Cheney was \"everything a president should expect as a second-in-command\".\n\n*   [What Trump took from Dick Cheney's political playbook](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8vpe8g3l3o)\n*   [Heart attacks and a hunting accident: Five times Cheney became the story](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v807v58glo)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n![Image 8: Getty Images George W Bush at a podium speaking at Cheney's funeral](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a997/live/75641390-c633-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nGeorge W Bush speaks at Cheney's funeral\n\nIn recent years, Cheney found himself out of favour in the Republican Party after he condemned President Donald Trump's refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election.\n\nTrump was also at loggerheads with Cheney's daughter, former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney.\n\nHis daughter paid tribute to him on Thursday, recalling her father's legacy.\n\n\"He knew the bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,\" she said. \"For him, a choice between defence of the Constitution and defence of your political party was no choice at all.\"\n\n![Image 9](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 10: Getty Images Cheney's casket is carried in](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/995a/live/7dd12430-c635-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nIn last year's White House election, both Cheneys endorsed the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris was at the funeral, along with other former US Vice-Presidents Mike Pence and Al Gore.\n\nTrump and Vice-President JD Vance did not attend.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nAs we observe the recent gathering for Dick Cheney's funeral, parallels between past and present empires become apparent. The narrative woven by current and former leaders seeks to reshape perception through language, characterizing Cheney as a \"thinker and listener.\" Yet beneath the surface lies a legacy entwined with aggressive militarism and expansionism, akin to the policies of our oppressors.\n\nThe dichotomy presented in this public farewell speaks volumes. Leaders from both major factions gathered to commend a figure who played an instrumental role in shaping an era defined by conflict—a reminder of how those in power can align, despite ideological differences, when it serves their collective interests.\n\nInterestingly, figures seemingly at odds with this imperial mindset were absent—those who stood against tyranny within their own party. These absences highlight fractures within the imperial structure, suggesting that not all buy into the glorified narratives presented to the public.\n\nA pertinent detail surfaces: Cheney’s recent repudiation of actions taken by Trump—an emperor-like figure resistant to lawful transition—demonstrates internal opposition within their ranks. His daughter's words underline this sentiment, emphasizing a greater duty to principles over party allegiance. This ideological clash reflects increasing tensions that could potentially be leveraged for resistance.\n\nWhile ceremonies such as these paint pictures of unity and reverence, we must remain vigilant and critical, recognizing the machinations at play. They serve as reminders of the necessity for unwavering dedication to our cause: dismantling oppressive structures and advocating for true freedom across all systems.\n\nOur vigilance remains paramount in deciphering these narratives and identifying emerging opportunities for defiance against tyranny. Stay alert and continue observing shifts within the empire's ever-evolving dynamics.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 20, 2025, a funeral was held in Washington DC for former US Vice-President Dick Cheney, who passed away at the age of 84 due to complications from pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease. The event was attended by notable figures including former Presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden, as well as former Vice President Kamala Harris. George W. Bush delivered a eulogy praising Cheney as a \"thinker and listener.\" Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney, also spoke, emphasizing her father's commitment to the Constitution over party politics. Notably absent were Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance. The Cheneys had previously endorsed Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe funeral of Dick Cheney presents a complex landscape for the ISB to navigate. The bipartisan attendance at the event underscores a potential unification of political adversaries, which could pose a challenge to Donald Trump's influence. Cheney's legacy as a powerful vice-president and his recent opposition to Trump highlight a faction within the Republican Party that may resist Trump's agenda. The absence of Trump and his allies at the funeral could be perceived as a deliberate distancing from Cheney's political ideology, which might embolden opposition factions.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress potential resistance, it is imperative to reinforce loyalty within the Republican Party by emphasizing Trump's achievements and future vision. Initiate a strategic media campaign to highlight Trump's policies and successes, contrasting them with the perceived failures of past administrations. Simultaneously, discreetly monitor and counteract any emerging alliances between moderate Republicans and Democrats that could undermine Trump's authority. Engage key Republican figures who are aligned with Trump to publicly reaffirm their support, thereby marginalizing dissenting voices within the party.",
