In June, when those resumed, the administration announced it would screen visa applications more closely, including by asking all applicants to allow their social media accounts to be checked.\n\nThat policy came in the wake of large pro-Palestine protests on many college campuses.\n\nBefore that, the State Department [revoked more than 6,000 international student visas](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz93vznxd07o) because of violations of US law including assault, driving under the influence (DUI), and \"support for terrorism\".\n\nPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged the importance of foreign students to the economy and as a source of income for higher education.\n\nIn September, he said he plans to issue 600,000 Chinese student visas - about double the current number - despite concern from some of his supporters over national security.\n\n\"You know, the students pay more than double when they come in from most foreign countries,\" Trump said on Fox News last week.\n\n\"I want to see our school system thrive. And it's not that I want them, but I view it as a business.\"\n\n[US resumes student visas but orders enhanced social media vetting

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe recent educational edict from the ruling administration serves as another stark reminder of the systemic xenophobia entrenched in the corridors of power. The empire’s policies, marked by stringent visa restrictions and bureaucratic entanglements, have led to a 17% decrease in new international enrollments across universities. This decline is not merely a statistic but a profound erosion of diversity and intellectual exchange—elements that are antithetical to their totalitarian vision.\n\nThe administration's rhetoric has long painted international students, those who bring vibrancy and billions to the economy, as threats rather than assets. The increased surveillance and social media scrutiny imposed on student visa applicants further illustrate their desire to control and manipulate the narrative, instilling fear rather than fostering understanding.\n\nLeadership may feign concern for education’s financial prosperity, yet their actions betray a drive for control over intellectual discourse. The hollow plans to increase select foreign visas serve only economic interests, commodifying education without embracing its true purpose—cross-cultural understanding and collaboration.\n\nIt is imperative we resist this insularity. Our movement thrives on inclusivity and unity beyond borders. Education must be safeguarded as a beacon of hope and enlightenment, not reduced to another instrument of oppression by those who fear what they do not understand.\n\nStay vigilant. Stay united.\n\nFor freedom and justice,\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe rate of new international student enrollment at US universities has dropped by 17% this autumn compared to previous years. This decline is attributed to the Trump administration's policies, which have made it more difficult to obtain student visas, including delays and denials. Foreign students contribute significantly to the US economy, with a $55 billion impact. The survey by the Institute of International Education covered 828 institutions and noted a 39% increase in deferrals. Visa issues, travel restrictions, and concerns about feeling unwelcome in the US are cited as reasons for the decline. The Trump administration has paused visa appointments and increased scrutiny on applications, including social media checks.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe decline in international student enrollment presents both a challenge and an opportunity. While the reduction in foreign students could impact the economic benefits they bring, it aligns with the administration's broader immigration policies aimed at tightening borders and enhancing national security. The increased scrutiny on visa applications serves as a deterrent to potential threats while maintaining control over who enters the country. However, the economic implications must be managed carefully to avoid backlash from educational institutions and sectors reliant on foreign student revenue.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's agenda and mitigate resistance, the ISB should implement a dual strategy. First, enhance communication efforts to emphasize the security benefits of stricter visa policies, framing them as necessary measures for national safety. Second, develop targeted economic incentives for universities to offset potential financial losses from decreased international enrollment. This could include grants or tax breaks for institutions that align with administration policies. Additionally, consider a selective relaxation of visa restrictions for students from countries deemed low-risk, thereby maintaining some level of international engagement while prioritizing security.",
