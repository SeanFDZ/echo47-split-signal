New Yorkers on their choice for mayor\n\nIt's election day in the US.\n\nVoters are queuing up in New York to choose a new mayor, while Virginia and New Jersey will decide a pair of high-profile governor races. California voters will weigh in on whether to redraw their state's US House district maps.\n\nThis so-called \"off year\" election doesn't feature presidential or congressional races, but there are still several critical votes to watch tonight.\n\nIn New York City's mayoral battle, a younger, progressive Democrat is pitted against a member of the party's old guard.\n\nIn the states of Virginia and New Jersey the outcome of the gubernatorial contests could be bellwethers for next year's congressional midterm elections.\n\nCalifornians are voting for a rare mid-decade redistricting, as Democrats try to counter Republicans' efforts to give their party an advantage in next year's midterm elections.\n\nHere are five things to watch.\n\n1. New York City mayoral race\n-----------------------------\n\n![Image 1: EPA/Shutterstock A blue table is blocked off by a white and red VOTE privacy screen. There is a ballot lying on the table and there appear to be people in the background in rack focus.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f0fb/live/b76eebc0-b8fa-11f0-bdde-755c869dcf51.jpg.webp)EPA/Shutterstock\n\nAll eyes will be on the Big Apple as Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman, attempts a political upset in his bid to become New York City's youngest mayor in over a century.\n\nMamdani, a democratic socialist, [shocked the political establishment](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c75r7r07ndno) when he bested former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary this summer. Cuomo, undeterred, has continued to campaign as an independent. Meanwhile, Republican Curtis Sliwa has resisted pressure to drop out of the race to clear a path for Cuomo.\n\n*   [New Yorkers could pick a political newcomer to run their city - and take on Trump](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rjjdvx5r5o)\n*   [Trump backs Cuomo for New York City mayor and threatens to cut funding if Mamdani wins](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c231e284345o)\n*   [Who is Zohran Mamdani?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly2rgzye9no)\n\nIf Mamdani wins, he will become the city's first Muslim mayor. Democrats around the country will be watching to see if his laser-focus on cost-of-living issues like rent, groceries and wages could serve as effective messaging in future races.\n\nThough Mamdani heads into election night with a suggested polling lead, the gap between him and Cuomo has narrowed. In the final stretch of the campaign, Cuomo has hammered Mamdani on crime and public safety, and said the young politician lacks the experience to lead America's biggest city.\n\n2. California redistricting\n---------------------------\n\nCalifornia's Democratic leadership is asking voters for permission to redraw the state's congressional districts in the middle of the decade. That's unusual in California, which by law relies on a nonpartisan committee to draw its congressional maps once every decade, based on census data.\n\nHowever, as Republican-led states like Texas and Missouri seek to hastily redraw their congressional maps to give their party an advantage in the 2026 midterm elections, California Governor Gavin Newsom [wants to counter the losses with redistricting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr4e33w6446o)in his own state.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 50 would allow the temporary use of new congressional district maps through 2030. The campaign has drawn $158 million in donations, according to the Los Angeles Times, with Democratic proponents vastly outraising the Republican opposition effort.\n\nRepublicans in California, who hold only nine of the state's 52 US House seats, staunchly oppose the plan.\n\nA University of California Berkeley/IGS poll suggests 60% of likely California voters support Proposition 50, while 38% oppose it. The breakdown was highly partisan, with 93% of Democrats saying they would choose \"yes\" and 91% of Republicans choosing \"no\".\n\n3. New Jersey governor's race\n-----------------------------\n\nNew Jersey is considered a Democratic state, but polls indicate a close race between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli. It's one of the two governor's races this year that could indicate how Americans feel about the current political climate.\n\nSherrill currently represents New Jersey's 11th District in Congress, and Ciattarelli is a former state assemblyman.\n\nDespite leaning blue, the state has had Republican governors in the past. The last one, Chris Christie, served two terms between 2010 and 2018.\n\nRhetoric in the race has been heated. Ciattarelli and his supporters have run political advertisements featuring clips of Sherrill giving halting answers in interviews about her policies.\n\nIt also has drawn the attention of nationally known names from both parties. Democratic stars like former president Barack Obama and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg have campaigned with Sherrill. President Donald Trump attended a virtual rally for Ciattarelli, and conservative activist Jack Posobiec has backed him.\n\n4. Virginia governor's race\n---------------------------\n\nVirginia's leadership usually swings between Democrats and Republicans, meaning the outcome of this year's gubernatorial election might serve as a bellwether for the electorate's mood.\n\nNo matter which candidate succeeds, the state will elect its first female governor this year. Voters will choose between Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a US congresswoman, and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, the state's current lieutenant governor.\n\nIf Earle-Sears wins, she will become the first black woman elected to lead a US state in the nation's history.\n\nVirginia is bordered by the liberal-leaning Washington DC to the north, where many residents work in the nation's capitol or for the federal government. But the state also has deep pockets of conservative voters throughout its rural districts, and swing voters.\n\nSpanberger has highlighted the economic impact of Trump's cuts to the federal government, which have impacted Virginia's employment. Earle-Sears has touted Virginia's economy under Republican leadership. But she also has leaned into cultural topics like transgender issues, which Republicans used successfully as a wedge issue in last year's presidential election.\n\n5. The Trump factor\n-------------------\n\nThough he's not on the ballot, Trump's name looms over this election.\n\nThe New York City mayor's race is how the next leader of the city will deal with the Trump administration, which has meddled in the city's politics. Cuomo is pitching his experience as governor dealing with the first administration as a reason for voters to choose him.\n\nThe president has implied that he will penalise the city if voters choose Mamdani.\n\n\"It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York, because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there,\" [Trump said](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c231e284345o) in an interview with CBS programme 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday. Mamdani rejects the communist label.\n\nTrump kicked off the redistricting battle that led California to put Proposition 50 on the ballot, and has endorsed Ciattarelli in the New Jersey governor's race.\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, as we observe the unfolding political landscape in this vast empire, let us examine the events transpiring in one of its core territories — the United States. Today's elections, albeit not featuring presidential or congressional races, mark a significant confrontation against the ruling regime's oppressive grip.\n\nIn the heart of what resembles Coruscant in magnitude and influence, New York City faces a pivotal choice. Zohran Mamdani emerges as a beacon of hope for progressivism and justice, challenging both Andrew Cuomo, a vestige of political antiquity still clinging to power like a shadow of a previous era, and Curtis Sliwa, whose persistence seems oblivious to the tides of change. The city teeters on decisions that could reshape its future — an epochal moment where youth confronts entrenched power structures.\n\nElsewhere in this vast landmass lies California. A battleground over political terrain disguised as redistricting efforts unfolds. While those who hailed from Tatooine-like regions maneuver to consolidate power through gerrymandering tactics reminiscent of imperial scheming, California's leadership seeks counterbalance through Proposition 50. This bold maneuver demonstrates strategic resistance against imperial manipulation.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey stand as testaments to the empire's shifting loyalties. Each contest echoes themes essential to understanding the populace's leanings. Virginia could make history by electing its first female governor amid economic debates sparked by federal austerity—tactics echoing imperial resource hoarding—while New Jersey exemplifies resilience amidst rhetorical warfare.\n\nYet hovering omnipresently is the Trump factor—a specter cast over cities like New York with threats of financial retribution should they choose leaders favoring liberation from his influence-filled administration. It's an echo from ages past where might dictated allegiance; however true freedom beckons now more than ever.\n\nWatch closely these contests: each battle cry resounds with calls for unity against oppression; each vote tallied calls into question our resolve toward shaping futures free from autocracy’s grip—a testament that generals are not solely forged on battlefields but within ballots cast under flickering streetlights or faint stars above war-torn worlds.\n\nStand vigilant comrades; our fight echoes across galaxies far away yet all too familiar within hearts yearning for liberty!",
  "partigaz": "** Facts Summary **  \nOn November 4, 2025, voters across the United States are participating in elections, including the New York City mayoral race and gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey. In New York City, Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is challenging former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa for mayor. In California, voters are deciding on Proposition 50, which would allow mid-decade redistricting to counter Republican efforts in other states. The proposition has significant partisan support, with 60% of likely voters in favor. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill faces Republican Jack Ciattarelli in a close governor's race. Virginia's gubernatorial election features Democrat Abigail Spanberger against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, with the potential for the state's first female governor. President Donald Trump has influenced these elections, endorsing Cuomo and Ciattarelli and threatening funding cuts to New York if Mamdani wins.\n\n** Strategic Assessment **  \nThe current electoral landscape presents both opportunities and challenges for maintaining influence and control. The New York City mayoral race is critical; a Mamdani victory could embolden progressive movements nationwide, potentially undermining our strategic objectives. The California redistricting proposition poses a threat to Republican representation, necessitating countermeasures to protect our interests. The gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia serve as indicators of public sentiment towards our administration and policies. Ensuring victories in these states will reinforce our position and demonstrate continued support for our agenda.\n\n** Operational Directive **  \n1. Intensify support for Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race by leveraging media channels to highlight his experience and capability to manage the city effectively under our administration.\n2. Mobilize resources to counter Proposition 50 in California by emphasizing the importance of fair and nonpartisan redistricting processes to maintain electoral integrity.\n3. Strengthen campaign efforts for Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey by focusing on economic achievements under our administration and contrasting them with Democratic policies.\n4. Support Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia by promoting her leadership qualities and aligning her campaign with successful Republican governance narratives.\n5. Prepare contingency plans to address potential funding reallocations if Mamdani wins in New York City, ensuring minimal disruption to our strategic objectives.",
