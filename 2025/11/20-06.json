Attorney General Pam Bondi called it a \"particularly selfish, cynical crime\".\n\nIn a statement, Ms Cherfilus-McCormick - who was elected to Congress in 2022 - maintained she was innocent and vowed to clear her name. She faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch: Cherfilus-McCormick on Capitol Hill day after indictment\n\nThe fraud was allegedly carried out through a healthcare company operated by the congresswoman and her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, 51, now co-accused.\n\nMs Cherfilus-McCormick was chief executive of the family firm, Trinity Healthcare Services, at the time.\n\nThe company had won a Fema contract to register people for Covid vaccines, but in July 2021 it received an overpayment of $5m in federal funds, according to the justice department.\n\nThe siblings allegedly tried to disguise the money's source by routing it through several accounts and eventually used \"a substantial portion\" on her congressional campaign.\n\nMs Cherfilus-McCormick and another person named in the indictment allegedly diverted funds from the Fema contract to friends and relatives, who donated the money back to her campaign as personal contributions, prosecutors said.\n\n\"No-one is above the law, least of all powerful people who rob taxpayers for personal gain,\" the attorney general said.\n\n\"We will follow the facts in this case and deliver justice.\"\n\nA federal grand jury in Miami approved the indictment on Wednesday.\n\nMs Cherfilus-McCormick said in a statement: \"This is an unjust, baseless, sham indictment - and I am innocent.\"\n\nShe added: \"I am deeply grateful for the support of my district, and I remain confident that the truth will prevail.\"\n\nHer lawyers, David Oscar Markus, Margot Moss, and Melissa Madrigal, said in a statement: \"We will fight to clear her good name.\"\n\nMs Cherfilus-McCormick is also under investigation by the House Ethics Committee.\n\nThe Office of Congressional Conduct said in its referral that she \"may have requested community project funding that would be directed to a for-profit entity\".\n\nOn Thursday, a Florida Republican congressman, Greg Steube, said he would introduce a resolution to expel Ms Cherfilus-McCormick.\n\n\"Defrauding the federal government and disaster victims of $5 million is an automatic disqualifier from serving in elected office,\" he said in a social media post.\n\n[Florida](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c77jz3mdq1jt)\n\n[Coronavirus vaccines](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c87z0we2g0zt)\n\n[Fraud](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cvwydw4g8pzt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[4 dead, 13 injured after street racer slams into crowd at Tampa bar -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyl6jwx2v8o)\n\n[Watch: Two people rescued after plane crashes in Everglades -----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c1dqwz61p74o)\n\n[Watch: 'Eeyore, you good boy' - Florida dog leads deputy to missing 86-year-old -------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c740pmjym4ro)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Replace Windows in Iowa [Don't Miss Out]Homeowners can save money by comparing window replacement quotes from specialists.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe recent news of a Florida congresswoman accused of embezzling $5 million in disaster funds is yet another reflection of the decadence and corruption thriving within the oppressive regime we oppose. The parallels between the alleged actions of this representative and the broader exploitations sanctioned by the Empire are striking. Just as the Empire plunders resources for personal and political gains, officials in positions of power within this administration mirror such greed, siphoning funds meant for relief to bolster their campaigns and entrench their power.\n\nThis case exemplifies how those at the helm exploit systemic vulnerabilities for their own benefit, leaving ordinary citizens bereft in times of need. It is a stark reminder that justice under such governance often only serves to protect those within its inner circles. Despite her proclaimed innocence, it is crucial to focus on the systems that allow and even encourage these patterns of injustice and exploitation.\n\nAs we rally against authoritarianism, let us draw strength from our collective resolve to dismantle such systems—those that thrive on inequality, exploitation, and deceit. In our continued struggle for justice and equality, moments like these serve as clarion calls reaffirming the necessity of our rebellion.\n\nStand firm in defiance.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nSheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Florida congresswoman, has been charged with stealing $5 million in federal disaster funds. The funds were allegedly laundered into her 2021 election campaign through a healthcare company operated by her and her brother, Edwin Cherfilus. The company received an overpayment from a FEMA contract intended for Covid vaccine registration. The indictment was approved by a federal grand jury in Miami, and she faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted. She maintains her innocence and is under investigation by the House Ethics Committee. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican congressman, plans to introduce a resolution to expel her from Congress.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe indictment of Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick presents an opportunity to reinforce the narrative of law and order under the current administration. Highlighting the swift legal action against corruption can be used to demonstrate the administration's commitment to accountability and justice. This case can also be leveraged to discredit opposition figures and reinforce the perception of widespread corruption among political adversaries. The involvement of high-profile figures like Pam Bondi in the prosecution can further legitimize the administration's stance.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Amplify media coverage of the indictment to emphasize the administration's zero-tolerance policy on corruption.\n2. Coordinate with allied media outlets to highlight the bipartisan nature of the investigation, showcasing it as a non-partisan effort to uphold integrity.\n3. Utilize social media platforms to disseminate statements from key figures like Pam Bondi, reinforcing the narrative of justice being served.\n4. Encourage Republican representatives, such as Greg Steube, to publicly support the expulsion resolution, framing it as a necessary step to maintain the integrity of Congress.\n5. Monitor public sentiment and adjust messaging to ensure continued support for the administration's actions in this case.",
