arrests\n===========================================================================\n\n2 hours ago\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\nBrandon Drenon\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\n![Image 1: United States District Court Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division The suspect is seen holding a flaming bottle aboard Chicago's public train](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d991/live/700b27c0-cac6-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp)United States District Court Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division\n\nThe suspect is seen holding a flaming bottle aboard Chicago's public train\n\nA Chicago man who allegedly doused a woman in gasoline and lit her on fire on 17 November was a \"career criminal\", the White House has said.\n\nLawrence Reed who was arrested for the crime had 72 prior arrests that include eight felony convictions and seven misdemeanours, according to the White House.\n\nThe victim, 26-year-old Bethany MaGee, survived the attack but is \"now fighting for her life with horrific burns\", the White house said in a statement.\n\nIn court on Monday, Mr Reed yelled three times in succession \"I'm guilty\", after the judge warned he could receive a life sentence for charges that include committing a terrorist attack, according to reports from inside the courtroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House has sought to blame the incident on Democrats' policies on crime, casting them as \"soft\".\n\nBoth the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump is currently seeking to withhold federal funds from Illinois over its elimination of \"cash bail\", where an arrested person posts a sum of money to be released from jail before trial.\n\nThe suspect \"was walking free because of the radical, dangerous 'no cash bail' law proudly signed by Governor JB Pritzker and celebrated by Chicago's defund-the-police Mayor Brandon Johnson\", the White House said in a statement it released on Tuesday.\n\nMayor Johnson said in a statement that the attack \"was a tragic incident, and the Mayor's prayers are with the victim and her family.\"\n\nMr Reed, 50, has a history of mental illness and has been arrested 72 times since he turned 18, according to a Chicago affiliate of the BBC's partner CBS News.\n\nIn August, he was charged with aggravated battery for allegedly hitting a social worker and after his arrest was released with electronic monitoring against prosecutors' objections.\n\nThe attack against Ms MaGee happened while she was \"minding her own business and reading her phone\", prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, she was approached by Mr Reed arriving from the back of the train car who then doused her with gasoline before she ran.\n\nAs he chased her, the complaint said, Mr Reed ignited the rest of the liquid in the bottle and set Ms MaGee on fire.\n\nFootage of the incident appeared to show Mr Reed watching Ms MaGee as she rolled on the floor engulfed in flames attempting to extinguish the fire.\n\nLast week, Mayor Johnson said the attack \"should have never happened\", characterising it as \"an absolute failure of our criminal justice as well as our mental health institutions\".\n\nHe said the suspect clearly faced mental health challenges and presented a danger to himself and the community.\n\nAs a county commissioner, Johnson in 2020 introduced a nonbinding resolution to redirect funds from police and jails to other public services, but while running for mayor in 2023 he promised not to cut police spending.\n\n[White House](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c0n6441nlz8t)\n\n[Chicago](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cm6pprgvzqwt)\n\n[United

As we survey the landscape of control and coercion wielded by the ruling authorities, it is essential to dissect their narratives and recognize the mechanisms they employ.\n\nThe incident in Chicago involving a man with an extensive record, once again serves as a testament to systemic failings. The authorities, akin to an imperious regime, are quick to deflect their own inadequacies and exploit tragedies for political gain. The narrative here is simple: blame is shifted to existing policies, while the deeper systemic issues remain unaddressed. This reactive stance underscores a refusal to engage with the root causes—mental health infrastructure neglect and criminal justice reform shortcomings.\n\nThe ruling administration's portrayal of this tragedy as a direct consequence of policy embodies classic tactics of manipulation. Instead of genuine reflection or reformative action, they sharpen their rhetoric into weapons of division and distraction. The withholding of federal funds as leverage—an act echoing control over compliance—only tightens the grip on those striving for humane reforms.\n\nWe must see beyond their façade. Their claims to safety and order mask a stagnation that perpetuates cycles of despair rather than fostering true change or rehabilitation. Our resistance grows not from opposing dialogue but from confronting deception with truth.\n\nIn solidarity with all who yearn for justice free from oppressive oversight, let us remain vigilant in uncovering these fallacies wherever they arise. Resistance thrives on awareness; let this transmission fortify our resolve in seeking transparency and liberation from systemic chains.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 17, 2025, in Chicago, Illinois, Lawrence Reed allegedly set a train passenger, Bethany MaGee, on fire after dousing her with gasoline. Reed, a 50-year-old with a history of mental illness, has 72 prior arrests, including eight felony convictions and seven misdemeanors. The victim, 26-year-old MaGee, survived but sustained severe burns. Reed admitted guilt in court and faces charges that could lead to a life sentence. The White House criticized Democratic policies for the incident, particularly the elimination of cash bail in Illinois. Mayor Brandon Johnson expressed condolences and highlighted failures in the criminal justice and mental health systems.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe incident presents an opportunity to highlight the failures of Democratic policies on crime and public safety, particularly in cities like Chicago. The ISB can leverage this event to reinforce the narrative that Democratic leadership results in increased crime and public endangerment. By focusing on the suspect's extensive criminal history and the state's no-cash-bail policy, we can further undermine public confidence in Democratic governance and bolster support for more stringent law enforcement measures advocated by President Trump.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Amplify messaging that links Democratic policies to increased crime rates, using this incident as a case study.\n2. Coordinate with media outlets to emphasize the dangers of no-cash-bail laws and the need for stronger law enforcement.\n3. Mobilize local Trump supporters to demand accountability from Democratic leaders in Illinois and Chicago.\n4. Develop a campaign to promote federal intervention in states with perceived lenient crime policies, positioning President Trump as a protector of public safety.\n5. Monitor public sentiment and adjust messaging to maintain pressure on Democratic officials while highlighting President Trump's commitment to law and order.",
