The ruling on Friday came after three of the court's five justices ruled that the law was invalid, however, it required the support of four justices to strike it down.\n\nViolating the state law comes with a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of $10,000 (£7,600).\n\nThe US Supreme Court overturned a [federal right to abortion in 2022](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54513499), leaving it up to states to regulate. North Dakota now joins 12 other states that have passed total bans on abortion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision comes after the law was challenged by an abortion clinic in the state. Courts had ruled that the ban could not go into effect while the legal case was ongoing.\n\nThe law contains exceptions if the mother's life is threatened, though rape and incest victims are only eligible for an abortion during the first six weeks of pregnancy - which opponents argue is before many women know they are pregnant.\n\nIn their ruling, the judges found that the state constitution does not provide a right to an abortion, and that the new law \"provides adequate and fair warning to those attempting to comply\".\n\nNorth Dakota's Republican Attorney Drew Wrigley praised the ruling, saying in a statement that the high court \"has upheld this important pro-life legislation, enacted by the people's Legislature\".\n\n\"The Attorney General's office has the solemn responsibility of defending the laws of North Dakota, and today those laws have been upheld.\"\n\nThe Red River Women's Clinic - which was the last abortion provider in North Dakota before moving to Minnesota in 2022 - has not yet reacted to the ruling.\n\n[Judge strikes down North Dakota's near-total abortion ban ---------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62r2zzgz4jo)\n\n[North Dakota bans almost all abortions --------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65389843)\n\n[What are the abortion laws in US states? ----------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvvvl9zq4eo)\n\n[Abortion](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c207p54m45dt)\n\n[US abortion debate](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cvj0q32px61t)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[New US rules say countries with diversity policies are infringing human rights ------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24200d7y9o)\n\n[Scottish abortion law 'not fit for purpose', says expert group --------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crre45x7n8jo)\n\n['Callous' amendment to include abortions in baby loss certificates defeated ---------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rp45nvkrqo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Council Bluffs: This Is How Much New Windows Should Cost in 2025 The True Cost of High-Performance Windows May Surprise You Modern Energy-Saving Windows | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://offers.renewalbyandersenpros.com/rba-home-v5 \"Council Bluffs: This Is How Much New Windows Should Cost in 2025\")[](https://offers.renewalbyandersenpros.com/rba-home-v5)\n\nUndo\n\n[Here's The Average Price of Gutter Protection For 2,500 Sq Ft House Choose LeafFilter gutter protection for your gutter needs.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, the latest developments within North Dakota reveal another step towards a darker future under an oppressive regime reminiscent of an Empire that thrives on control and suppression. The state Supreme Court's decision to uphold a near-total abortion ban serves as a stark reminder of the erosion of freedoms and autonomy. \n\nThe ruling signifies more than just legislative power; it represents the tightening grips of those in power over personal liberties, using legal frameworks to enforce their doctrine upon everyone. Under this newly sanctioned law, performing an abortion has been escalated to a felony crime with severe punishments—a potential five-year imprisonment alongside a hefty fine. This is nothing short of institutionalized surveillance and control over bodies, aligning with the broader agenda set forth by similar state-level autocracies.\n\nAs seen in past maneuvers, this action echoes the wider imperialist strategy where states are left to dictate the terms of personal rights, leading to fragmentation and inconsistency reminiscent of divide-and-conquer tactics. These laws, ridged with limited exceptions that barely address issues like rape or incest effectively, underscore an agenda less about life and more about control.\n\nThe statement from North Dakota's Attorney General praising such pro-life legislation highlights the deep-seated narrative being pushed—one that reveres legislative supremacy over individual choice. The people's Legislature may have crafted these laws but let us never lose sight that true ethical governance is defined not just by legal enactment but by safeguarding universally acknowledged human rights.\n\nOur spirits must not waver in this oppressive landscape. The struggle continues for bodily autonomy, equality, and fundamental rights for all beings under regimes determined for dominance. Our solidarity stands firm against tyranny masked as lawfulness; we must continue to advocate for justice on all fronts.\n\nStay vigilant; our fight against this imperial age persists with renewed tenacity.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 22, 2025, North Dakota's state Supreme Court upheld a law making it a felony to perform an abortion in the state. The law includes penalties of up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. This decision follows the US Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that left abortion regulation to individual states. North Dakota joins 12 other states with total abortion bans. The law allows exceptions if the mother's life is at risk, but limits abortions for rape and incest victims to within six weeks of pregnancy. The Red River Women's Clinic, which challenged the law, has not yet responded to the ruling.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes this ruling as a significant victory in consolidating control over reproductive rights, aligning with the broader strategic objectives of reinforcing conservative values and strengthening state autonomy over federal oversight. This decision serves as a precedent for other states considering similar legislation, potentially leading to a more unified front among states with similar ideological leanings. The ruling also presents an opportunity to further marginalize opposition groups by framing them as out of touch with state and national values.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Public Messaging Campaign**: Launch a coordinated media campaign highlighting the ruling as a triumph of state rights and moral governance. Emphasize the protection of life and family values, appealing to core conservative constituencies.\n\n2. **Legal Reinforcement**: Encourage other states to adopt similar legislation by providing legal support and resources. Facilitate workshops and conferences for state legislators to share strategies and experiences.\n\n3. **Monitor Opposition**: Intensify surveillance on groups opposing the ruling, particularly those attempting to provide abortion services across state lines. Utilize intelligence to preemptively disrupt their operations.\n\n4. **Community Engagement**: Mobilize grassroots organizations to promote community support for the ruling. Organize rallies and events that celebrate the decision, fostering a sense of unity and purpose among supporters.\n\n5. **Policy Expansion**: Explore additional legislative measures that can further restrict abortion access, such as limiting telehealth services for abortion-related consultations and increasing penalties for non-compliance.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will strengthen its influence, support Donald Trump's agenda, and effectively neutralize resistance efforts.",
