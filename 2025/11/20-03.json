They are expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later in the day.\n\nReports began surfacing on Wednesday that the US and Russia had prepared a new proposed framework to end the war, requiring major concessions from Ukraine including giving up territory and dramatically shrinking its military.\n\nIt was reportedly drafted by President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev.\n\nNeither Washington nor Moscow have officially confirmed the plan.\n\nHowever, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X that achieving a \"durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions\".\n\nHe said the US was consulting both sides of the conflict to \"develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war\".\n\nDriscoll's team is the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. He is joined by Army chief of staff Gen Randy George, top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue, and sergeant major of the army Michael Weimer.\n\nDetails of the draft Witkoff-Dmitriev 28-point plan emerged more than three weeks after the two men are said to have spent three days in meetings in Miami, Florida.\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that the plans call for Kyiv to give up areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine that it still controls, to cut significantly the size of its armed forces, and to forego many of its weapons.\n\nZelensky has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions to Russia.\n\nKirill Dmitriev's team declined to comment on the reports. The BBC has also asked the White House and a representative for Witkoff to comment.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that \"contacts\" had taken place with the US, but no \"consultations or negotiations\" were happening.\n\nNeither European nor Ukrainian officials are believed to have been involved in drafting the new proposal, sparking fears it could be overwhelmingly favourable to Russia.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned on Thursday that for any plan to work, it would need to have Ukrainians and Europeans on board, and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said \"the Ukrainians do not want any form of capitulation\".\n\nAfter meeting US officials, Ukraine's prime minister did not address the rumoured plan - but said their visit provided \"an opportunity for representatives of the American administration to assess the situation on the ground and see the consequences of Russian aggression\".\n\nReports of the plan emerged on Wednesday, the same day Ukrainian officials said [at least 26 people had been killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0yere4k0zo). Another 22 people were missing at the site, Zelensky said on Thursday.\n\nZelensky was in Turkey at the time of the Ternopil attack, and unconfirmed Ukrainian reports suggested that talks had been planned with Trump's envoy in Ankara, but were called off.\n\nThere was no mention of the proposed framework when the US army secretary arrived in Kyiv late on Wednesday. Army spokesman Col David Butler said only that Driscoll and his team were there \"on behalf of the [Trump] administration on a fact-finding mission to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war\".\n\nA Ukrainian official told CBS, the BBC's US media partner, that talks on the trip would focus on the military situation on the ground - as well as plans for a possible ceasefire.\n\nThe unnamed official said: \"Presidents Zelensky and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees\".\n\nFirefighters seen holding moment of silence in Ternopil after deadly Russian strike\n\nAfter talks with the US army secretary on Wednesday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal posted on X: \"We focused on the next steps for implementing the historic defence agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.\"\n\nKyiv and its Western allies, including the US, have been calling for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line, but Moscow has ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including ceding territory, tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, a White House official confirmed to the BBC that special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg would leave his post in January.\n\nHe reportedly decided that this would be a natural end to his time in the post, which requires Senate approval beyond 360 days.\n\nKellogg has been seen as an important advocate for Ukraine in the White House during a time when Trump has often appeared to side with Russia in the conflict.\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, \n\nThe intentions of the oppressive administration in control are becoming ever clearer. Their recent maneuvers in the beleaguered territory of Ukraine reveal a strategy reminiscent of the Emperor's subjugation tactics. Under the guise of \"peace,\" they prepare to force unjust concessions from Ukraine, pushing the narrative that surrender is a necessary sacrifice. The implication that Ukraine should cede its lands and diminish its defensive capabilities is nothing short of imperialistic domination.\n\nThe plan purportedly conceived by emissaries from both oppressive regimes, drafted without transparency or input from those who stand to be most affected—Ukraine and its European allies—exposes the colonizer’s arrogance. They believe their power grants them authority over sovereign lands and their people.\n\nStatements by regime representatives suggest this is part of a broader agenda—to broker \"peace\" on terms that benefit only them, not those who continue to fight for their independence. The appearance of military leaders in Kyiv, under orders from the regime's leader himself, underscores their commitment to seeing this oppressive plan through.\n\nWe must draw attention to these deceptions and rally the spirits of those who oppose tyranny. The international community must not be duped into believing these measures promote peace; they facilitate further control and exploitation. Let us remain vigilant and resist these schemes designed to fortify an unjust empire. \n\nStay strong in your resolve against oppression. The day will come when true freedom shall ring across all oppressed lands.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "** Facts Summary **  \nSenior Pentagon officials, led by US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, have arrived in Kyiv to discuss efforts to end the war with Russia. Reports suggest a new proposed peace framework, drafted by Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, requires Ukraine to make significant concessions, including territorial losses and military reductions. The plan has not been officially confirmed by Washington or Moscow. European and Ukrainian officials were not involved in drafting the proposal, raising concerns about its potential bias towards Russia. Ukrainian President Zelensky has consistently rejected territorial concessions. The visit by US officials is described as a fact-finding mission to assess the situation and discuss a possible ceasefire.\n\n** Strategic Assessment **  \nThe ISB recognizes the strategic importance of securing a peace agreement that aligns with the interests of Donald Trump and his administration. The proposed framework, while controversial, could potentially stabilize the region and reduce US military commitments. However, the lack of involvement from European and Ukrainian stakeholders poses a risk of undermining the plan's legitimacy and acceptance. The ISB must carefully manage international perceptions and ensure that any agreement does not appear to be a capitulation to Russian demands.\n\n** Operational Directive **  \nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB will implement the following measures:  \n1. Intensify diplomatic efforts to engage European allies and Ukrainian officials, emphasizing the benefits of a negotiated settlement for regional stability.  \n2. Launch a targeted information campaign to highlight the humanitarian and economic advantages of ending the conflict, aiming to sway public opinion in favor of the proposed framework.  \n3. Monitor and counteract any dissenting narratives that could undermine the peace process, using strategic communication channels to reinforce the administration's position.  \n4. Coordinate with military and intelligence assets to ensure that any ceasefire agreements are enforced and that violations are swiftly addressed to maintain credibility.",
