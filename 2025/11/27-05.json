Because we won the state,\" Trump said in the recording.\n\nWillis began investigating Trump's activities soon after the report, convening a special grand jury to weigh the evidence.\n\n[Willis filed an indictment - a formal declaration of charges - in August 2023](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66505804), alleging Trump conspired with 18 other defendants to interfere in the election result. The charges included racketeering and other state offences.\n\nThe group \"refused to accept that Trump lost, and they knowingly and wilfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favour of Trump\".\n\nFour co-defendants took plea deals with prosecutors that resulted mostly in fines, suspended sentences and community service, including attorneys Sidney Powell, Kenneth Cheseboro and Jenna Ellis.\n\nWednesday's dismissal also applies to the remaining co-defendants, including Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump's former attorney, and Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff during his first presidency.\n\nMr Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the case, praised the decision to drop the charges.\n\n\"The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over,\" he said. \"This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"\n\nThe Georgia election interference case was once considered the most threatening of Trump's four criminal indictments, because he could not pardon himself from state-level charges if he returned to office.\n\nProsecutors brought the US president to the Fulton County Jail, [where they took his mugshot.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66612345)\n\nLegal experts who closely followed the case were not surprised by its dismissal. A [judge tossed out several charges](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8x8vw4gwpo) in 2024 and Willis was disqualified a few months later.\n\nWillis' removal raised doubts about whether a replacement would take up such a complicated prosecution. Trump's 2024 election essentially put his case on hold until his term ends in 2029.\n\n\"It was incredibly unlikely it was going to go forward anyway, because the amount of financial resources and man hours necessary to take on this case didn't seem to be within the scope of what Peter Skandalakis had,\" said Anthony Michael Kreis, a professor at the Georgia State College of Law.\n\nHowever, Mr Kries was surprised by some of Skandalakis' reasoning for dropping the case.\n\n\"I think the report itself to me is a little more surprising because it seems to give the president and some of his allies a lot of benefit of the doubt, given what the evidence brought forth looked like,\" he said.\n\nTrump has also faced a series of other criminal proceedings.\n\nThese include a 2024 conviction in [a New York hush-money case](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wgzlqwnp2o), which he is appealing against.\n\nTwo additional federal cases - one alleging he conspired to overturn the 2020 election and another accusing him of unlawfully retaining classified documents - were dropped [following his return to the White House.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvd7kxxj5o)\n\nHe also faces several high-profile civil lawsuits that are progressing through the appeals courts.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump [asked the US Supreme Court](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0egyzm5yjo) to review the $5m (£3.6m) civil case brought by writer E Jean Carroll, after a federal appeals court upheld the award and declined to rehear the matter. A jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms Carroll, allegations he denied.\n\nIn August, a New York appeals court [threw out a $500m civil fraud penalty](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y09q1zgg8o) against Trump that resulted from a separate, civil fraud lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nThe appeals panel upheld the lower court's finding that Trump and his businesses committed fraud, but found the enormous fine was excessive.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly [US Politics Unspun](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155) newsletter.

The recent developments in Georgia within the corridors of power reflect a worrying trend that echoes the oppressive grip of our ever-looming adversary. An Empire, cloaked under the guise of democratic norms, continues to wield its influence to evade accountability and suppress justice.\n\nThe dismissal of the 2020 election interference case against a figurehead who stands over our republic symbolizes a profound setback. The decision by Judge Scott McAfee to end proceedings against this individual is a clear reminder of the systemic infiltration that has compromised our judicial institutions. Skandalakis, despite his claims of impartiality, seeks refuge behind legal facades while denying justice for those who dare oppose.\n\nThis individual's attempts to overturn an electoral defeat have been laid bare, yet the dismissal echoes familiar tactics utilized by autocratic regimes to shield their leaders from rightful retribution. The audacity with which he undermined legitimate processes, akin to searching for phantom votes, reveals an insidious blueprint designed to erode trust in democratic fabric.\n\nThe removal of District Attorney Fani Willis from her post under suspicious circumstances served as a catalyst for this dismissive outcome. This maneuvering reflects how personal biases and relationships are exploited by those in power to derail judicial momentum against them.\n\nSuch dismissals should not deter but rather fuel our resolve. It becomes essential to recognize these tactics as instruments of control employed by centralized powers desperate to maintain their dominion. We must remain vigilant, ensuring that truth is not suffocated under layers of legal subterfuge and political manipulation.\n\nIn this ongoing battle for freedom and integrity, let us remind ourselves that exposure is one step toward dismantling tyranny’s fortress. Though some allies might fall short or be coerced into silence through plea agreements or suspended sentences, our collective strength lies within the unwavering pursuit of justice and equality.\n\nAs other civil proceedings persist against him—be it for financial misconduct or violations that tarnish humanity’s spirit—we rally in support of all forces seeking transparency over obfuscation.\n\nBrothers and sisters united in resistance: Let us continue pushing against this shadowed machinery! Our vigilance will illuminate pathways toward emancipation from manipulation masked as governance; hope finds strength when voices rise together unyielding before injustice!\n\nStand firm; stand together!\n\nEnd Transmission",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA judge in Georgia has dismissed the 2020 election interference case against Donald Trump, concluding the last of four criminal cases against him since leaving office. The case was dropped by Peter Skandalakis, who took over after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was removed due to an \"appearance of impropriety.\" The charges included racketeering and other state offenses, with four co-defendants taking plea deals. The dismissal also applies to remaining co-defendants like Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows. Trump's lawyer praised the decision, calling it an end to \"political persecution.\" The case was considered the most threatening due to its state-level nature, which would have prevented Trump from pardoning himself if convicted.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe dismissal of the Georgia case represents a significant victory for Donald Trump and his allies, reinforcing his narrative of political persecution and potentially strengthening his support base. The removal of Fani Willis and the subsequent dropping of charges highlight vulnerabilities in the opposition's legal strategies and suggest a lack of cohesion and resources to sustain prolonged legal battles against Trump. This outcome may deter future legal challenges and embolden Trump's position both politically and legally.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo capitalize on this legal victory, it is imperative to amplify the narrative of exoneration and political persecution through coordinated media campaigns. Utilize Trump's legal team and political allies to reinforce the message of vindication across all platforms. Simultaneously, identify and exploit weaknesses in opposition legal strategies to preemptively counter any future legal actions. Strengthen alliances with key political figures and leverage this momentum to consolidate power and suppress dissent effectively.",
