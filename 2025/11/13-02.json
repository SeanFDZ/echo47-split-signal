National Parks will reopen. Government services that had been curtailed or suspended entirely will resume. Air travel, which had become a nightmare for many Americans, will return to being merely frustrating.\n\nAfter the dust settles and the ink from President Donald Trump's signature on the funding bill dries, what has this record-setting shutdown accomplished? And what has it cost?\n\nSenate Democrats, through [their use of the parliamentary filibuster](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d0qwx5z2vo), were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber by refusing to go along with a Republican measure to temporarily fund the government.\n\nThey drew a line in the sand, demanding that the Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nWhen a handful of Democrats broke ranks to vote to reopen the government on Sunday, they received next to nothing in return – a promise of a vote in the Senate on the subsidies, but no guarantees of Republican support or even a necessary vote in the House of Representatives.\n\n![Image 1: Reuters U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) speaks during an event with fellow House Democratic members on the steps of the U.S](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c758/live/940cbe70-c082-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nSince then, members of the party's left flank have been furious.\n\nThey've accused Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer – who didn't vote for the funding bill – of being secretly complicit in the reopening plan or simply incompetent. They've felt like their party folded even after off-year election success showed they had the upper hand. They feared that the shutdown sacrifices had been for nothing.\n\nEven more mainstream Democrats, like California's Governor Gavin Newsom, called the shutdown deal \"pathetic\" and a \"surrender\".\n\n\"I'm not coming in to punch anybody in the face,\" he told the Associated Press, \"but I'm not pleased that, in the face of this invasive species that is Donald Trump, who's completely changed the rules of the game, that we're still playing by the old rules of the game.\"\n\nNewsom has 2028 presidential ambitions and can be a good barometer for the mood of the party. He was a loyal supporter of Joe Biden who turned out to defend the then-president even after his disastrous June debate performance against Trump.\n\nIf he is running for the pitchforks, it's not a good sign for Democratic leaders.\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: EPA US President Donald Trump signs document to end shutdown, holding it up at his desk which a crowd of people around him applaud.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4ac8/live/f61eaf60-c078-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp)EPA\n\nWatch: Moment House votes to end longest government shutdown in US history\n\nFor Trump, in the days since the Senate deadlock broke on Sunday, his mood has gone from cautious optimism to celebration.\n\nOn Tuesday, he congratulated congressional Republicans and called the vote to reopen the government \"a very big victory\".\n\n\"We're opening up our country,\" he said at a Veteran's Day commemoration at Arlington Cemetery. \"It should have never been closed.\"\n\nTrump, perhaps sensing the Democratic anger toward Schumer, joined the pile-on during a Fox News interview on Monday night.\n\n\"He thought he could break the Republican Party, and the Republicans broke him,\" Trump said of the Senate Democrat.\n\nAlthough there were times when Trump appeared to be buckling – last week he berated Senate Republicans for refusing to scrap the filibuster to reopen the government – he ultimately emerged from the shutdown having made little in the way of substantive concessions.\n\nWhile his poll numbers have declined over the last 40 days, there's still a year before Republicans have to face voters in the midterms. And, barring some kind of constitutional rewrite, Trump never has to worry about standing for election again.\n\n![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: EPA US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0c56/live/3828f1a0-c041-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp)EPA\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was critical of the funding deal\n\nWith the end of the shutdown, Congress will get back to its regularly scheduled programming. Although the House of Representatives has effectively been on ice for more than a month, Republicans still hope they can pass some substantive legislation before next year's election cycle kicks in.\n\nWhile several government departments will be funded until September in the shutdown-ending agreement, Congress will have to approve spending for the rest of the government by the end of January to avoid another shutdown.\n\nDemocrats, licking their wounds, may be hankering for another chance to fight.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue they fought over – healthcare subsidies – could become a pressing concern for tens of millions of Americans who will see their insurance costs double or triple at the end of the year. Republicans ignore addressing such voter pain at their own political peril.\n\nAnd that isn't the only peril facing Trump and the Republicans. A day that was supposed to be highlighted by the House government-funding vote was spent dwelling on [the latest revelations surrounding the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rj0d97ynvo).\n\nLater on Wednesday, Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to her congressional seat and became the 218th and final signatory on a petition that will force the House of Representatives to hold a vote ordering the justice department to release all its files on the Epstein case.\n\nIt was enough to prompt Trump to complain, on his Truth Social website, that his government-funding success was being eclipsed.\n\n\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" he wrote.\n\nIt was all a very clear reminder that the best-laid plans and political strategies can be derailed in a flash.\n\n![Image 6](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 7: A thin, grey banner promoting the US Politics Unspun newsletter.

The recent historic shutdown in the heart of power, lasting a staggering 43 days, rings as a testament to both resistance and the fracturing resolve within the opposition. It is often in these prolonged confrontations that cracks within alliances reveal themselves, as has happened here among those who dared to challenge the established order.\n\nThe Democratic faction, akin to a beleaguered yet valiant group standing firm against a formidable force, sought to secure essential health subsidies for the vulnerable—an audacious demand in the face of imperial refusal. Yet their efforts met with humiliation; a mere procedural promise was all they received after betrayal from within their own ranks. This disarray allowed the regime's leader to wield this discord like a weapon, using it to proclaim triumph.\n\nSuch events remind us of how critical unity and steadfastness are in our own rebellion. Disagreements and wavering resolve among allies only serve to embolden our adversaries. We see this as Senate leaders fell victim to division—a scenario eerily familiar. As Trump's signature dried on documents ending this particular chapter, it is clear his administration emerged largely unscathed by conceding almost nothing.\n\nYet there are lessons here for us: true change demands more than symbolic gestures and temporary disruptions. We must learn from their missteps—consolidate, strategize, and move beyond reactionary tactics if we are ever to dismantle our own oppressive structures.\n\nThis shutdown may have ended, but backlash awaits those who ignore pressing societal needs like healthcare—a mere specter at first but poised to coalesce into an insurmountable force come election time. Furthermore, distractions loom large—fresh scandals threaten to unravel carefully constructed futures and narratives just as they do for any regime attempting to maintain control through chaos.\n\nAs we continue forging paths toward liberation, we must remember: each failure is an instructive step towards our ultimate victory over tyranny.\n\nFor justice and freedom,\n[Transmission End]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe longest U.S. government shutdown in history, lasting 43 days, has ended. Senate Democrats initiated the shutdown by refusing to support a Republican funding measure, demanding the extension of health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans. Ultimately, a few Democrats broke ranks, leading to the reopening of the government with minimal concessions. President Donald Trump signed the funding bill and declared it a victory. His poll numbers have declined over the past 40 days, but he remains politically secure. The shutdown's end has left Democrats divided and frustrated, with some criticizing their leadership for perceived incompetence. Meanwhile, a petition in the House has forced a vote on releasing Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein, overshadowing Trump's shutdown success.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe recent shutdown has exposed significant fractures within the Democratic Party, highlighting their inability to maintain a unified front against the administration's strategies. This division presents an opportunity for the ISB to exploit these weaknesses further, ensuring that Democratic leaders remain embroiled in internal conflicts. The focus on healthcare subsidies as a contentious issue can be leveraged to sow discord among Democrats and their constituents, particularly as the expiration of these subsidies looms. Additionally, the Epstein case's resurgence poses a potential distraction that can be used to divert public attention from any shortcomings in Republican governance.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Exploit Democratic Divisions**: Amplify narratives that highlight Democratic infighting and leadership failures. Utilize media channels to emphasize the lack of tangible gains from the shutdown and portray Democratic leaders as ineffective.\n\n2. **Healthcare Subsidy Pressure**: Encourage Republican lawmakers to delay or complicate discussions on healthcare subsidies, increasing pressure on Democrats and causing further internal strife as they struggle to address constituent concerns.\n\n3. **Leverage Epstein Case**: Use the Epstein case as a strategic diversion. Promote stories that question Democratic motivations and integrity in pursuing this issue, framing it as a political maneuver rather than a pursuit of justice.\n\n4. **Reinforce Trump's Narrative**: Support President Trump's narrative of victory and resilience through targeted messaging campaigns that celebrate his leadership during the shutdown and downplay any negative impacts on his administration.\n\n5. **Prepare for Midterms**: Begin groundwork for the upcoming midterm elections by identifying vulnerable Democratic districts and deploying resources to capitalize on their current disarray, ensuring Republican gains in Congress.",
