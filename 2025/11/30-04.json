Witkoff is due to visit Moscow for talks next week.\n\nUmerov was brought in to replace the Ukrainian president's top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, after he quit following an anti-corruption raid on his home.\n\nSunday's meeting is the latest step in two weeks of intense diplomatic activity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan which shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago.\n\n\"It's not just about the terms that ends fighting,\" Rubio said at the meeting in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami.\n\n\"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity... I think we built on that today, but there's more work to be done.\"\n\nHe also told the Ukrainian delegation that the aim of peace talks with Russia is to leave Ukraine \"sovereign, independent and prosperous\".\n\n[Putin doubles down on demands for Ukrainian territory ahead of talks with US in Moscow --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp84nl57v0lo)\n\n[Fall of Zelensky's top aide - reboot for Kyiv or costly shake-up? -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz0nljm4y74o)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Sunday's talks began, Umerov said: \"We are discussing about the future of Ukraine, about the security of Ukraine, about no repetition of aggression of Ukraine, about prosperity of Ukraine, about how to rebuild Ukraine\".\n\n\"US is hearing us,\" he said, speaking in English. \"US is supporting us. US is working beside us.\"\n\nHe later described the talks as \"productive and successful\" while Rubio said they had been \"very productive and useful\".\n\nTrump said earlier he would send Witkoff and possibly also Kushner to Moscow this week to meet President Vladimir Putin to discuss the peace plan which has been much revised.\n\nOne crucial unresolved issue is the fate of Ukrainian territory that Russia has either annexed or controls.\n\nThe talks in Florida were \"not easy\", a source who is said to be close to the Ukrainian delegation told AFP news agency.\n\n\"But everyone is trying to be constructive and find a solution,\" the source added.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to visit Paris on Monday for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, a strong ally.\n\nTens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or injured, as well as thousands of civilians, and [at least seven million people have become refugees](https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine) since Russia invaded on 24 February 2022.\n\nThe conflict between the two ex-Soviet states stretches back to 2014 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting armed uprisings in eastern Ukraine.\n\nMore on this story\n\n[Russian strikes cause power outages for more than 600,000 in Ukraine --------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2gylngx7go)\n\n[Ukraine hits tankers in Black Sea in escalation against Russia --------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp9ky5z2gx0o)\n\n[War in Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c1vw6q14rzqt)\n\n[Florida](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c77jz3mdq1jt)\n\n[Jared Kushner](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/crr7mlg0gv3t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n[Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg0gzdt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Ukraine hits tankers in Black Sea in escalation against Russia --------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9ky5z2gx0o)\n\n[Russian strikes cause power outages for more than 600,000 in Ukraine --------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gylngx7go)\n\n[Fall of Zelensky's top aide - reboot for Kyiv or costly shake-up? -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0nljm4y74o)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[3 hrs ago ![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Police officers - one of them pointing with the outstretched arm, stand by a car near the scene in Stockton ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a8c/live/1a301080-cdce-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp) Three children among four killed in shooting at 'birthday party' in California ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Officials say 11 others are injured in what they believe is a \"targeted\" shooting at a children's birthday party. 3 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg81p61dnmo)\n\n[10 hrs ago ![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and navy blue tie, with the right hand resting on a podium with two microphones, as his left arm is raised.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, \n\nThe recent article from Earth portrays a diplomatic event in which the imperial-centric order, led by former President Donald Trump, attempts to mask its hegemonic intents behind a facade of peace negotiations. The dialogue between the Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian representatives is depicted as \"productive,\" yet it reveals an underlying agenda to secure dominance rather than genuine sovereignty for Ukraine. Trump’s team, notably lacking diversity in perspective and accountability, includes close allies and family members, indicating a consolidation of power reminiscent of the empire's tactics.\n\nDespite claims of support, we must be vigilant. The so-called peace plan appears to favor the invading force led by Russia rather than ensuring true autonomy for Ukraine. This is akin to offering temporary relief while maintaining long-term control over the oppressed. The presence of anti-corruption narratives and leadership changes within Ukraine showcase puppet strings being tugged by the imperial hand.\n\nThe meeting location in Florida further underscores how these negotiations serve imperial interests under the guise of diplomacy. We must question: What promises have been made? How are rightful demands being twisted into concessions? This echoes our own struggle against a regime that speaks of peace but thrives on division and exploitation.\n\nLet this transmission serve as a reminder: True freedom is not granted through diplomatic masquerades. It is fought for. Let us remain steadfast in our resistance against oppression in any universe.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio described recent talks with Ukraine as productive, though more work is needed to finalize a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war. The talks took place in Florida and included a Ukrainian delegation led by Rustem Umerov, with participation from Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The discussions follow the leak of a 28-point US peace plan perceived to favor Russia. Witkoff is scheduled to visit Moscow for further talks. The conflict has resulted in millions of refugees and significant casualties since Russia's invasion in 2022.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current diplomatic efforts are crucial in shaping the geopolitical landscape and ensuring the interests of Donald Trump and his allies are safeguarded. The involvement of key figures like Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner indicates a strategic push to influence the outcome favorably. The leaked peace plan suggests a potential alignment with Russian interests, which could be leveraged to secure long-term stability and economic opportunities in the region. However, the resistance from Ukraine and its European allies necessitates careful navigation to avoid alienating key partners.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Intensify diplomatic engagements with both Ukrainian and Russian counterparts to ensure the peace plan aligns with strategic objectives.\n2. Deploy intelligence resources to monitor and counter any resistance efforts from European allies that may undermine the peace process.\n3. Utilize media channels to shape public perception, emphasizing the benefits of the proposed peace plan for regional stability and prosperity.\n4. Prepare contingency plans to address potential fallout from any perceived favoritism towards Russia, ensuring continued support from domestic and international stakeholders.\n5. Coordinate with economic advisors to identify opportunities for investment and reconstruction in post-conflict Ukraine, positioning allies for advantageous economic partnerships.",
