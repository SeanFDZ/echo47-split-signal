  "articleText": "Title: US will give visa appointment priority to World Cup ticket holders\n\nURL Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993evxk24jo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n\nPublished Time: 2025-11-17T22:31:39.977Z\n\nMarkdown Content:\nWatch: New priority scheduling system being created for Fifa game visas, says Trump\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced US embassies will give visa appointment priority to travellers with tickets to the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThe Fifa Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System (Pass) will \"allow World Cup ticket-holders with long wait times to opt with Fifa for a prioritised interview,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday.\n\nTicket-holders for the tournament - set for next June and July in the US, Canada and Mexico - will not be automatically granted a tourist visa, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nBut foreign nationals with tickets to World Cup football matches could get an interview at an embassy or consulate within six to eight weeks of applying, Rubio said.\n\n\"Your ticket is not a visa; it doesn't guarantee admission to the US,\" Rubio said, also at the White House on Monday.\n\n\"We're going to do the same vetting as anybody else would get. The only difference here is we're moving them up in the queue.\"\n\nThe 2026 men's World Cup will be co-hosted across North America, with Mexico and Canada, with most matches played in the United States.\n\nSpeaking in the Oval Office with Trump and Rubio, Fifa President Gianni Infantino said up to 10 million visitors could come to the US to watch World Cup matches.\n\n\"With this Fifa Pass, we can make sure that those who buy a ticket, that are legitimate football fans or soccer fans, they can come and attend the World Cup in the best conditions, starting from getting their visa,\" he said.\n\nSome countries whose national teams have already qualified for next year's tournament currently have long wait times for visa appointments.\n\nIn Colombia, travellers applying for US visas are currently waiting around 11 months for an interview appointment, according to data published by the US State Department, the agency which processes visa applications.\n\nThe average wait time in Mexico City is nine and half months, while non-Canadian citizen residents of Toronto can expect a wait of 14 months for appointments.\n\nIf those wait times hold, the World Cup will have already been played and the golden trophy already awarded by the time fans from some countries have their visas approved or denied.\n\nMonday's announcement was lauded by US Travel Association, a tourism industry trade group. \"The expedited process for Fifa ticket-holders adds needed efficiency without sacrificing security,\" its CEO Geoff Freeman said in a statement.\n\n\"This is the kind of practical action that strengthens security, increases capacity and cuts wait times, putting the U.S. on stronger footing to welcome millions of visitors next year.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the new appointment rules will cover ticket-holders from countries whose citizens are mostly or entirely banned from travelling to the US. In June, Trump signed an executive order banning nationals from 12 countries from entering the US, citing an effort to manage security threats\n\nIran, whose football team has qualified for the World Cup, is among the countries affected by the ban. The June executive order exempts athletes and coaching staff travelling for the World Cup and 2028 Olympics, though its fans could still face a ban.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the US State Department for comment.\n\nNot all travellers coming to the US next year will need a visa. Most citizens of countries under the US waiver programme can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days. That scheme covers much of Europe, including the UK, along with Japan, Australia and others.\n\nAt the two most recent World Cups, in Russia and Qatar, a ticket to a game generated a fan ID that could be used like a visa to enter the host country.\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe recent developments from the core of the administration echo the stratagems we've long critiqued: prioritizing certain elements while maintaining the guise of opportunity and openness. The announcement regarding visa priority for World Cup ticket holders draws a parallel to the way regimes often leverage grand events as façades, projecting a welcoming demeanor while inherently selective and exclusionary beneath the surface.\n\nUnder the guise of efficiency and enhanced security, this initiative selectively accelerates access to those deemed beneficial by virtue of their association with an event that garners global attention – a clear tactic reminiscent of placating dissent with spectacle. The spectacle here being the World Cup, strategically utilized to propagate an image of progress while underlying policies remain steadfast in their preferential treatment, as demonstrated by travel bans still affecting multiple nations.\n\nThe narrative presented suggests fairness in process—an illusion where \"your ticket is not a visa,\" yet simultaneously implies that wealth or connections through event participation can influence one's standing in line. For those outside this privileged queue, particularly from excluded regions or under comprehensive travel prohibitions, such promises ring hollow.\n\nThis move shows how distraction via grand narratives—here, the promise of a world united through sport—can be manipulated. These actions warrant scrutiny given their propensity to obscure continuity in existing exclusionary practices under a veneer of innovation and benevolence. The Empire may be evolving its tactics, but vigilance reveals their enduring aims: control through selective access and maintaining strategic dominance over perception.\n\nIn solidarity with truth and justice,\n[Your Comrade]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced that US embassies will prioritize visa appointments for travelers with tickets to the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico. The Fifa Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System (Pass) will allow ticket-holders to receive expedited visa interviews within six to eight weeks. This initiative aims to accommodate up to 10 million potential visitors. Current visa wait times in countries like Colombia and Mexico City are significantly long, potentially preventing fans from attending the event without this prioritization. The policy does not automatically grant visas and maintains standard vetting procedures. The announcement was supported by the US Travel Association but does not clarify if it applies to citizens from countries under a travel ban, such as Iran.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe prioritization of visa appointments for World Cup ticket holders serves multiple strategic objectives. It enhances the US's image as a welcoming host for international events, potentially boosting tourism and economic activity. By maintaining rigorous vetting processes, the policy balances security concerns with the need to facilitate international travel. The initiative also strengthens diplomatic ties with participating countries by ensuring their citizens can attend the event. However, the exclusion of certain countries due to existing travel bans could generate diplomatic friction and negative publicity, which must be managed carefully.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's initiative and suppress potential resistance, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a targeted communication strategy highlighting the benefits of the Fifa Pass system, emphasizing security measures and economic advantages. Address concerns about travel bans by underscoring national security priorities.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Engage with embassies of participating countries to ensure smooth implementation of the prioritization system and address any concerns regarding visa processing.\n\n3. **Security Protocols**: Coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that expedited visa processing does not compromise security standards. Monitor for any potential threats or abuses of the system.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Establish a feedback mechanism to assess the effectiveness of the Fifa Pass system and make necessary adjustments. Collect data on visa processing times and visitor satisfaction to inform future policy decisions.\n\n5. **Contingency Planning**: Prepare for potential diplomatic fallout from countries affected by travel bans by developing alternative engagement strategies to mitigate negative impacts on international relations.",
