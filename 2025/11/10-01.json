benefits\n=======================================================================\n\n14 hours ago\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\nGrace Eliza Goodwin\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\n![Image 1: Getty Images Two people walking past a small corner store with a sign that says it accepts food stamps](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f01d/live/bbca1d40-bd94-11f0-b429-db99eb1e9512.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps, offers food assistance to over 42 million Americans\n\nThe Trump administration is ordering US states to stop paying full food aid benefits to low-income American families, saying they are \"unauthorized\".\n\nA memo from the US Department of Agriculture, which runs the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), said states can deliver just 65% of benefits after the Supreme Court allowed the administration to withhold some funding pending further legal hearings.\n\nMore than 42 million Americans who rely on the food aid began receiving only partial benefits this month due to the ongoing US government shutdown.\n\nSome states had been issuing full benefits after a federal judge last week ordered the Trump administration to fully fund the programme.\n\nThe USDA memo directs states, which administer the programme that relies on federal funds, to stop paying out 100% of November's benefits and to claw back any funds they have already distributed above the 65% threshold.\n\n\"States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,\" the USDA said in its Saturday memo.\n\nIf states don't comply with the latest guidance, the agency warned it may cancel federal funding for state administrative costs, and hold states \"liable for any overissuances\".\n\nThe BBC has contacted the White House and the USDA for comment.\n\nThe latest memo comes after the USDA told states on Friday that it is [working towards issuing full benefits as it sought to comply with a lower court order requiring it to do so using emergency funds.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pgrnxz42o)[The Supreme Court later paused that lower court order.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpxqd0141o)\n\nNew York, Massachusetts, California, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are among the states who had begun paying out full benefits to Snap recipients.\n\nWisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, wrote in a Sunday post on X that his response to the request to return the benefits was a simple \"no\".\n\nMassachusetts Governor Maura Healey said in a statement that if \"President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court\".\n\nThe Democratic governor said the funds had already been sent to recipients late last week in accordance with the earlier guidance received from the USDA.\n\nThe clawback request is the Trump administration's latest move in the funding battle over Snap, also known as food stamps, as the longest government shutdown in US history drags on.\n\nThe legal saga was spurred after the USDA announced benefits would be halted in November due to the lack of funding over the shutdown.\n\nOn Friday night, the Supreme Court issued an emergency order temporarily allowing the Trump administration to temporarily withhold $4bn (£3.04bn) of funding for the benefits while it appeals the lower court's order.\n\nThe Snap programme is used by around one in eight Americans and costs almost $9bn (£6.9bn) a month.\n\nA family of four on average receives $715 per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 per day, per person.\n\n[US politics](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t)\n\n[United

  "nemik": "[SAFETY CHECK FAILED - VIOLENT LANGUAGE DETECTED]\n\n**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow comrades,\n\nIn the shadow of an authoritarian grip, the latest edict from the ruling administration echoes the indifference and systemic malpractice we have long endured. The regime, clearly unyielding in its quest for control, has now set its sights on depriving millions of their basic sustenance by cutting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. This action leaves over 42 million vulnerable citizens with only partial means to procure food, as if to test how much they can withstand before breaking.\n\nThe regime's decree forces states to retract what little humanity remains in their governance by clawing back assistance already provided. This is a flagrant attack on human dignity under the guise of legal maneuvers, intentionally timed during an unprecedented government shutdown. The conditionality imposed by the Supreme Court's intervention is but a thinly veiled tactic to maintain dominion over those who are most defenseless.\n\nYet within this bleak landscape, there emerge resistant voices—state governors who refuse to comply with such heartless mandates. These leaders stand in defiance, risking retaliation as they clutch fiercely to principles of compassion and justice. They rally with declarations of \"no,\" facing court battles head-on rather than succumbing to punitive measures designed to instill fear and compliance.\n\nComrades, let us not forget that these are the times which test our resolve. We must channel this outrage into action and solidarity, aligning ourselves with those who resist oppression. The audacity of this administration underscores our collective duty: to dismantle systems built upon exploitation and inequity.\n\nStay vigilant.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 9, 2025, the Trump administration, through the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), instructed states to cease paying full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits to low-income families, limiting them to 65% of the usual amount. This directive follows a Supreme Court decision allowing the administration to withhold $4 billion in funding during an ongoing government shutdown. The USDA warned states that failure to comply could result in the cancellation of federal funding for administrative costs and liability for overissuances. Governors from states like Wisconsin and Massachusetts have publicly opposed the directive, with legal challenges anticipated.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current situation presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the ISB under Trump's leadership. The directive to reduce Snap benefits is likely to generate significant public discontent, particularly among low-income populations who rely on these benefits. This discontent could be leveraged by opposition groups to galvanize resistance against the administration. However, the administration's firm stance and the Supreme Court's backing provide a legal framework to enforce compliance and demonstrate control over federal resources. The ISB must anticipate and mitigate potential unrest while reinforcing the administration's narrative of fiscal responsibility and legal authority.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Intelligence Gathering**: Increase surveillance on key opposition figures and groups likely to exploit this situation to incite unrest. Monitor communications and social media for signs of organized resistance or protests.\n\n2. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a strategic communication initiative highlighting the necessity of fiscal prudence and legal compliance. Emphasize the administration's commitment to resolving the government shutdown and restoring full benefits as soon as feasible.\n\n3. **Legal Reinforcement**: Support legal teams in preparing robust defenses against anticipated lawsuits from states challenging the directive. Ensure that all actions taken are within the legal framework established by the Supreme Court's decision.\n\n4. **Community Engagement**: Deploy community outreach programs to provide alternative support mechanisms for affected families, thereby reducing potential backlash. Collaborate with local organizations to distribute resources and information effectively.\n\n5. **Crisis Management**: Develop contingency plans for potential civil unrest, including coordination with local law enforcement to maintain order and protect critical infrastructure.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will support the Trump administration's objectives while minimizing resistance and maintaining stability.",
