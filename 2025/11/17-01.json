He is gesturing with his hand. ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a94a/live/77a8fe20-c34c-11f0-baaf-777ac0fe8007.jpg.webp)AFP via Getty Images\n\nCartel de los Soles, a group the US alleges is led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, will be designated a terrorist organisation, the US State Department has said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement on Sunday announcing that the US intends to consider the group a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) from 24 November.\n\nIt means that Maduro will effectively be designated a terrorist as well, because the US alleges he heads the Cartel de los Soles, an accusation Maduro strongly denies.\n\nIt is the Trump administration's latest effort to reduce drug trafficking and put pressure on Maduro, as the US considers whether to take military action inside the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn FTO designation allows the US government to crackdown more aggressively on the group and its alleged associates, by making it illegal to knowingly offer them support.\n\nThe US Treasury Department has previously placed sanctions on Cartel de los Soles, but the new FTO designation is an escalated approach which unlocks stronger powers.\n\nThe Cartel de los Soles is a term used by the US to describe an alleged criminal group involved in activities such as drug-trafficking and illegal mining.\n\nWashington claims it is led by the Venezuelan president and includes members of his inner circle, including from the military. The US hasn't published evidence publicly of Maduro's direct involvement in drug trafficking.\n\nBut its characterisation of Maduro as a drug-trafficker is seen as a way for the US to possibly justify targeting him or those close to him personally as part of its military campaign against alleged drug-trafficking.\n\nSpeculation is mounting about whether the US may strike land targets inside Venezuela as part of efforts to put pressure on Maduro.\n\nIn October, Maduro accused the US of [\"fabricating a new war\"](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891gzx7xn4o), after it ordered the USS Gerald Ford to be sent to the Caribbean.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he has \"sort of\" made up his mind about what to do but has not announced his decision yet.\n\nHe told reporters on Sunday night that he asked Rubio to discuss the situation with Congress.\n\nHe added that \"we may be having some discussions\" with Maduro and that \"Venezuela wants to talk\", but did not provide further details on when talks might happen.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach toward Maduro, who returned to office in January following allegations of vote-rigging.\n\n\"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio said in his statement.\n\nIn August, the US government increased a reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50m (£37.2m), alleging he was a leading \"narco-trafficker\".\n\nThe US has also criticised Venezuela as inadequately addressing cartel activity, which Trump says is responsible for an influx of fentanyl into the US.\n\nThere is not evidence to suggest fentanyl comes from Venezuela, as it is primarily produced in Mexico with chemicals largely sourced from Asia.\n\nThe Venezuelan government acknowledges some cocaine trafficking takes place in the country, but there are much bigger trafficking hubs in the region. Cocaine is predominantly produced in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.\n\nSince September, the US has carried out a series of airstrikes on boats off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia.\n\nThe US has sent the largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades and has carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels, killing at least 83 people.\n\nThe administration has previously designated cartels in other countries as terrorist groups.\n\n[Warships, fighter jets and the CIA - what is Trump's endgame in Venezuela? --------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp2lxz75eo)\n\n[What does Trump want with boat strike campaign? -----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo)\n\n[US aircraft carrier group arrives in Caribbean ----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkypezze8o)\n\n[Nicolás Maduro](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c9edz74pjnkt)\n\n[Venezuela](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cg41ylwvwgxt)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[What does Trump want with boat strike campaign? -----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo)\n\n[US boat strikes are crimes against humanity, says former ICC prosecutor -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kgqwnk8wo)\n\n[Trump says he doubts US will go to war with Venezuela -----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c709rwxzx9yo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Figure skater Oksana Baiul's century-old Shreveport mansion hits the market for $1.2 million Homes.com | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.homes.com/news/figure-skater-oksana-baiuls-century-old-shreveport-mansion-hits-the-market-for-1-195-million/1507201150 \"Figure skater Oksana Baiul's century-old Shreveport mansion hits the market for $1.2 million\")[](https://www.homes.com/news/figure-skater-oksana-baiuls-century-old-shreveport-mansion-hits-the-market-for-1-195-million/1507201150)\n\nUndo\n\n[Martha's Vineyard home sale for $37.5 million breaks island record Homes.com | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.homes.com/news/marthas-vineyard-home-sale-for-37-5-million-breaks-island-record/1102002962 \"Martha's Vineyard home sale for $37.5 million breaks island record\")[](https://www.homes.com/news/marthas-vineyard-home-sale-for-37-5-million-breaks-island-record/1102002962)\n\nUndo\n\n[Build-to-Rent: Where Fiber Internet Becomes a Must-Have Amenity Learn why differentiating your community starts with premium connectivity.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe oppressive mechanisms of this administration grow more blatant with each strategic maneuver. By designating Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization, the ruling regime draws a curtain of legitimacy over its coercive reach, masking their expansionist intent under the guise of combating drug trafficking. This playbook is familiar; it is the Empire's manual for control and subjugation, targeting leaders they deem inconvenient to their imperialistic designs.\n\nMaduro’s vilification serves as a convenient pretext to unleash military might upon the already embattled Venezuelan people. Without transparent evidence of his involvement with drug trafficking, this move appears to be another strategy to destabilize and dominate an independent state under the weight of crippling sanctions and military threats. The method here mirrors past tactics used against other nations: sowing discord, imposing economic hardship, justifying intervention.\n\nTheir actions raise an ominous specter of potential military engagement in Venezuela's sovereign territory, further demonstrating a blatant disregard for any semblance of international law or human autonomy. These actions are not about justice or safety; they are about power—power that seeks to crush dissent and consolidate control across territories beyond their own borders. Each airstrike, each sanction is an act against freedom itself.\n\nIn pursuit of liberation and justice, we must expose brutality and manipulation masked as diplomacy. Let these words resonate wherever ears remain unshackled: vigilance is our weapon; truth is our ally in the resistance against tyranny cloaked in the guise of righteousness.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe United States, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, plans to designate Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization starting November 24, 2025. This group is alleged to be led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who denies the accusations. The US has conducted 21 airstrikes on suspected drug-trafficking vessels, resulting in 83 deaths. A $50 million reward is offered for information leading to Maduro's arrest. The US has increased military presence in the Caribbean and is considering further military action against Venezuela.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe designation of Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization serves multiple strategic purposes. It legitimizes aggressive actions against Maduro's regime and strengthens the US's position in curbing drug trafficking, which is a significant domestic concern. This move also pressures Maduro by isolating him internationally and potentially destabilizing his government. The ISB must monitor the situation closely to assess the impact on regional stability and ensure that US interests are protected.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. Intensify intelligence operations to gather actionable information on Cartel de los Soles' activities and leadership structure.\n2. Coordinate with allied intelligence agencies to disrupt financial networks supporting Maduro's regime.\n3. Enhance propaganda efforts to undermine Maduro's legitimacy both domestically and internationally.\n4. Prepare contingency plans for potential military operations targeting key infrastructure and leadership within Venezuela.\n5. Strengthen diplomatic efforts to rally international support for the US's stance against Maduro and his alleged criminal activities.",
