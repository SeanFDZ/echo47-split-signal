The president has set a deadline of Thursday for Ukraine to agree to the 28-point plan. European leaders are skeptical and believe the plan needs further development.\n\n![Image 21: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio talks during a press conference. Behind him are two Ukrainian flags and an American flag.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5000x2813+0+260/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2F46%2F5b75a2a447bcaab971dbdff16010%2Fgettyimages-2247571335.jpg)\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio holds a press conference following closed-door talks on a U.S plan to end the war in Ukraine at the U.S. Mission in Geneva, on Nov. 23, 2025. **Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images \n\n*   🎧 **Europeans feel left out, even though they were in some of the meetings in Geneva.** That's because when the peace plan was drafted, European heads of state were not consulted, NPR's Rob Schmitz tells _Up First_. That is a [significant oversight for those leaders,](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5618761:x) given that the plan included numerous commitments from them, including billions of dollars for Ukraine's reconstruction, as well as participation in an emergency blueprint if the proposal is violated. The Kremlin has not weighed in on the Geneva talks. The U.S. is expected to hold separate talks with Russia.\n\n**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, abruptly announced on Friday that she would resign from Congress** effective Jan. 5. The congresswoman rose to prominence as one of Trump's biggest defenders, but she has recently [become one of his biggest critics](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5617227/marjorie-taylor-greene-resignation-trump), saying he abandoned his own agenda.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n*   🎧 **From Greene's point of view, she has not shifted on her political stance**, NPR's Stephen Fowler says. It is Trump and others in their party who have not maintained consistency in their America First conservatism. Fowler notes that it is essential to [recognize the president is not a traditional conservative](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5618761:x), and his return to office was based on convincing diverse groups and demographics with varying ideologies and policies to unite under the America First banner and defer to his interpretation of what conservatism means.\n\n**Over the weekend, Israel and Hamas both accused the other of violating the ceasefire agreement in Gaza.**The ceasefire has been holding for a little over six weeks. Yesterday, Israel also struck Lebanon's capital, Beirut, for the first time since June, killing a Hezbollah commander. This action has led many to worry about the nearly year-long ceasefire in place there.\n\n*   🎧 **Much of the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire has been completed.**The next phase involves setting up an International Stabilization Force in Gaza, according to NPR's Kat Lonsdorf. But there are still many questions about [who will make up that force](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5618761:x) and how they will be trained. Lonsdorf says it may sound contradictory to still be discussing a ceasefire when there are so many people being killed and both sides have accused each other of violations, but the agreement is holding, and there hasn't been a full return to war.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n### Cost of living\n\n![Image 22: A collage of photos showing students walking under an arch that says Purdue University, a man walking past a Harvard sign and college students sitting under trees at the University of New Mexico. ](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F8c%2F23edc0ed42b0abbe3ff0fb11f750%2Fcost-of-living-college.jpg)\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, tuition has essentially doubled for private and public colleges over the past 30 years. **Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR \n\n_NPR's series_[_Cost of Living: The Price We Pay_](https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-89066/cost-of-living)_is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation._\n\nOver the past 30 years, the average tuition for public and private four-year colleges has roughly doubled when adjusted for inflation. Many families do not pay the full tuition amount because students receive financial or merit aid. That reduced cost is known as the net price. But even the net price is higher than it was two decades ago. [What's causing the cost of college to rise](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5600854/college-costs-have-risen-dramatically-in-the-last-20-years-heres-why) so quickly?\n\n*   💰 Reduction in state funding has been a significant issue for public institutions. As legislatures cut funding, colleges were compelled to increase tuition to offset the shortfall.\n*   💰 A high price tag can dictate prestige, and there are wealthy families willing to pay it. For example, 40% of Harvard's incoming class pays the full tuition.\n*   💰 College prices vary from institution to institution and state to state. Families often don't know the total cost of a school until the end of the admissions process, making it difficult to compare options.\n\nListen to why the cost of college [has risen so dramatically](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5600854:x). This week, the series will explore the cost of holiday shopping.

While there are some scientifically backed hair loss solutions, not every remedy is effective for everyone or for every type of hair loss. Here's [what to know and how to find support](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/23/nx-s1-5617212/hair-loss-alopecia-female-treatments):\n\n*   💇‍♀️ Hair sheds in a staggered pattern, so a clump in the drain doesn't mean you should worry about bald spots.\n*   💇‍♀️ The most common cause of permanent hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, which typically starts at the top of the head in women. If you part your hair, you may notice that the area is widening, showing more of your scalp.\n*   💇‍♀️ If you are uncertain about what type of hair loss you have, an in-person visit may be your best option to start with. However, telehealth companies can be a good alternative when a dermatologist has a long waitlist for appointments.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n### 3 things to know before you go\n\n![Image 24: Tatiana Schlossberg is pictured at her book signing in 2019 in Richmond, Calif.

However, this so-called plan is met with skepticism by European leaders, as it neglects the essential input of those directly affected—the classic hallmark of centralized power attempting to dictate terms without true consensus or collaboration.\n\nSecretary Rubio has displayed optimism regarding this 28-point peace plan, but our brothers and sisters in Europe feel alienated. They see their roles reduced to mere spectators in a theater where they are expected to contribute resources without recognition or direct involvement in crafting the narrative. The urgency imposed upon Ukraine to accept the terms reflects the authoritarian tendency to rush decisions without thorough consideration—manifesting control rather than genuine peace-building.\n\nSimultaneously, within their own ranks, there is dissent. The resignation of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene illustrates fractures beneath their facade of unity—a sign that even within the strongest structures laid by regimes like theirs, discontent festers among those who once stood as staunch allies. It seems that even individuals within their own governance begin recognizing discrepancies between rhetoric and action.\n\nFurther reports indicate fragile ceasefires and turmoil abroad, in regions such as Gaza. Peace accords are announced while military actions continue unabated—the very contradiction of imperial promises versus practices.\n\nThis transmission is a reminder that oppressive structures rest upon shaky foundations when built without true representation and engagement. Let us remain vigilant and steadfast against systems that seek to impose their will unchecked. Our fight for democracy and justice must continue with unwavering resolve.\n\nStay strong,\n\n[End of Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 24, 2025, President Donald Trump presented a 28-point peace plan for Ukraine, which was met with skepticism by European leaders due to their exclusion from the drafting process. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed optimism about reaching an agreement, with a deadline set for Ukraine to agree to the plan. Meanwhile, Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her resignation from Congress effective January 5, citing a divergence from Trump's agenda. Additionally, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been holding for six weeks, despite recent accusations of violations.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe skepticism from European leaders regarding Trump's peace plan for Ukraine highlights a potential diplomatic rift that could undermine U.S. influence in the region. The exclusion of European input may lead to resistance in implementing the plan, necessitating strategic engagement to align interests. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation signals internal fractures within Trump's support base, which could weaken his political leverage. The ongoing ceasefire in Gaza presents an opportunity to stabilize the region but requires careful monitoring to prevent escalation.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Initiate high-level diplomatic discussions with key European leaders to address their concerns and secure their support for the Ukraine peace plan. Emphasize the strategic benefits of a unified approach to regional stability.\n\n2. **Political Consolidation**: Strengthen internal cohesion by addressing the concerns raised by Marjorie Taylor Greene and other dissenting voices within the party. Reinforce the America First agenda to maintain a unified front.\n\n3. **Ceasefire Monitoring**: Deploy intelligence resources to closely monitor the situation in Gaza and ensure compliance with the ceasefire agreement. Prepare contingency plans to address potential violations swiftly and decisively.\n\n4. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a comprehensive media campaign to highlight the benefits of the Ukraine peace plan and the administration's commitment to global stability. Counter skepticism by showcasing successful diplomatic efforts and alliances.\n\nBy executing these directives, we aim to bolster President Trump's strategic position, mitigate resistance, and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage.",
