He has also been a trusted confidante of Zelenskyy's for years.\n\nThe unprecedented searches at the heart of Ukraine's government come at a time when Kyiv is under intense U.S. pressure to sign a peace deal nearly four years after Russia invaded.\n\nTwo national agencies fighting entrenched corruption in Ukraine said their searches targeted Yermak. Oleksii Tkachuk, a spokesperson for Yermak, said the anti-graft agencies had not served Yermak a notice of suspicion, meaning he was not a suspect in an investigation. Tkachuk added that Yermak had not been told what the searches related to.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n### [World](https://www.npr.org/sections/world/)\n\n### [Ukraine's $100 million energy scandal triggers resignations and tests Zelenskyy](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/17/nx-s1-5608255/ukraines-100-million-energy-scandal-triggers-resignations-and-tests-zelenskyy)\n\nYermak, a powerful figure in Ukraine and a key participant in talks with the United States, confirmed they searched his apartment inside the presidential compound in downtown Kyiv, where checkpoints limit public access. Media reports said Yermak's office was also searched, but investigators declined to comment on that.\n\nIt was not clear where Zelenskyy or Yermak were at the time of the morning raid.\n\n\"The investigators are facing no obstacles,\" Yermak wrote on the messaging app Telegram. He added that he was cooperating fully with them and his lawyers were present.\n\n### Energy sector\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office are Ukrainian anti-corruption watchdogs. They are currently leading a major investigation into a $100 million energy sector corruption scandal involving top Ukrainian officials which has dominated domestic headlines in recent weeks.\n\nIt was not clear if the searches were connected to the case and a spokesperson for the NABU, Anton Tatarnikov, declined to comment, citing legal restrictions on revealing details on an ongoing probe.\n\nA spokesperson for the European commission, Guillaume Mercier, told Ukrainian local news, Radio Svoboda, on Friday that they were following developments closely and that the searches showed that Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies were working. He added that fighting corruption was central to the country's European Union accession.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nInvestigators suspect that Tymur Mindich, a one-time business partner of Zelenskyy, was the plot's mastermind. Mindich has fled the country, with any criminal proceedings against him likely to be carried out in absentia. Two top government ministers have resigned in the scandal.\n\nTwo of Yermak's former deputies — Oleh Tatarov and Rostyslav Shurma — left the government in 2024 after watchdogs investigated them for financial wrongdoing. A third deputy, Andrii Smyrnov, was investigated for bribes and other wrongdoing but still works for Yermak.\n\n### Political turmoil\n\nThe scandal has heaped more problems on Zelenskyy as he seeks continued support from Western countries for Ukraine's war effort and tries to ensure continued foreign funding. The European Union, which Ukraine wants to join, has told Zelenskyy he must crack down on graft.\n\n[![Image 18: Outside a destroyed apartment building in the western Ukrainian city of Ternopil, local residents have left flowers, candles and stuffed toys to commemorate the dozens, including several children, killed in an overnight Russian attack](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4284x4284+0+941/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2F0d%2F88601a0541659663def4da87720f%2Fimage00006.jpeg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/23/g-s1-98981/ukrainian-anger-at-new-peace-proposals)\n\n### [Ukraine invasion — explained](https://www.npr.org/series/1082539802/russia-ukraine-invasion-explained)\n\n### [Amid smoldering wreckage, anger at Ukraine peace proposal many consider lopsided](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/23/g-s1-98981/ukrainian-anger-at-new-peace-proposals)\n\nZelenskyy faced an unprecedented rebellion from his own lawmakers earlier this month after investigators published details of their energy sector investigation.\n\nAlthough Yermak was not accused of any wrongdoing, several senior lawmakers in Zelenskyy's party said Yermak should take responsibility for the debacle in order to restore public trust. Some said that if Zelenskyy didn't fire him, the party could split, threatening the president's parliamentary majority. But Zelenskyy defied them.\n\nZelenskyy urged Ukrainians to unite and \"stop the political games\" in light of the U.S. pressure to reach a settlement with Russia.\n\nYermak met Zelenskyy over 15 years ago when he was a lawyer venturing into the TV production business and Zelenskyy was a famous Ukrainian comedian and actor.\n\nHe oversaw foreign affairs as part of Zelenskyy's first presidential team and was promoted to chief of staff in February 2020.\n\nYermak has accompanied Zelenskyy on every trip abroad since Russia's invasion in February 2022, and the president's trust in him has made Yermak's power appear almost untouchable.\n\nDomestically, officials describe Yermak as Zelenskyy's gatekeeper, and he is widely believed to have chosen all top government appointees, including prime ministers and ministers.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIndividuals connected to Yermak and the president's office have come under investigation before.\n\n*   [Ukraine-Russia](https://www.npr.org/tags/1251330900/ukraine-russia)\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 19: Firefighters put out the fire after a drone hit a multi-storey residential building during Russia's night drone attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Tuesday.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860+0+450/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fff%2F9a32048643329def07f99053aef7%2Fap25329152810481.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/25/g-s1-99216/russia-ukraine-attacks)\n\n##### [Ukraine invasion — explained](https://www.npr.org/series/1082539802/russia-ukraine-invasion-explained)\n\n#### [Russian attacks kill at least 7 in Ukraine as talks on a U.S. peace plan continue](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/25/g-s1-99216/russia-ukraine-attacks)\n\n[![Image 20: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, holds a press conference following closed-door talks on a US plan to end the war in Ukraine at the US Mission in Geneva, on November 23, 2025.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, it is with a sense of urgency that I transmit this latest intelligence concerning the ongoing situation in Ukraine—a beacon of hope and resistance against the oppressive forces that aim to control it. The latest dispatch reveals that President Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, has resigned amidst expanding corruption investigations. This development comes at a critical juncture as Ukrainian sovereignty continues to be threatened by external pressures, particularly from the U.S., which seeks to impose a peace deal under conditions favoring Russian interests.\n\nThe resignation signifies not only a pivotal moment in Ukraine's internal power dynamics but also illustrates the relentless integrity of the anti-corruption agencies fighting against entrenched malfeasance. Let these developments be a lesson and an inspiration to those fighting against any form of tyranny. The investigations into Yermak are linked to a broader probe into a $100 million energy sector scandal—proof that corruption is not merely endemic but institutional and often leveraged by authoritarian regimes as they seek to maintain their grip on power.\n\nWe note with concern the pressure applied on Ukraine by U.S. authorities for a settlement that could potentially compromise its autonomy. A testament to freedom's fragility when faced with imperialistic overreach masquerading as diplomacy.\n\nThe atmosphere within Ukraine's political landscape grows tumultuous, with factions demanding Yermak bear responsibility for missteps—an indication of the people's demand for accountability from those in power. As parallels arise between this situation and our own struggles, let us remain vigilant and prepared.\n\nContinue your mission with renewed conviction, recognizing that change often begins with courageous acts of defiance, even when faced with overwhelming odds. Our goal remains just as crucial: resist oppression in all its forms.\n\nStay the course,\n\n[Transmission Ends]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 28, 2025, Andrii Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, resigned following searches of his residence by anti-corruption investigators in Kyiv, Ukraine. The investigations are part of a broader probe into a $100 million energy sector corruption scandal. Although Yermak has not been formally accused of any wrongdoing, the situation has intensified political pressure on Zelenskyy, who is under U.S. pressure to sign a peace deal with Russia. The European Union has emphasized the importance of addressing corruption as part of Ukraine's EU accession process.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe resignation of Andrii Yermak amid corruption investigations presents a strategic opportunity to influence the political landscape in Ukraine. The instability within Zelenskyy's administration could be leveraged to weaken his position and sway public opinion against him. This situation also provides an opening to promote narratives that align with our interests, particularly in framing the Ukrainian government as ineffective and corrupt. The ongoing U.S. pressure on Ukraine to reach a peace settlement with Russia can be used to further destabilize Zelenskyy's support base and create divisions within his party.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Information Campaign**: Launch a targeted information campaign highlighting the corruption within Zelenskyy's administration. Emphasize the $100 million energy scandal and the resignation of key officials as evidence of systemic corruption. Utilize social media platforms and sympathetic media outlets to amplify these narratives.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Pressure**: Encourage allies to publicly question Ukraine's commitment to anti-corruption reforms and EU accession criteria. This will increase pressure on Zelenskyy and potentially weaken his international support.\n\n3. **Support Opposition**: Identify and support opposition figures within Ukraine who can capitalize on the current political turmoil. Provide them with platforms to voice their criticisms of Zelenskyy's handling of the corruption scandal and peace negotiations.\n\n4. **Leverage U.S. Relations**: Use existing channels to influence U.S. policymakers to maintain or increase pressure on Ukraine for a swift resolution with Russia. Highlight the instability as a reason for expedited peace talks, which could further strain Zelenskyy's leadership.\n\n5. **Monitor Developments**: Continuously monitor the situation for any shifts in power dynamics or emerging opportunities to further our strategic objectives in the region. Adjust tactics as necessary to maintain influence over the unfolding events.",
