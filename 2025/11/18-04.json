We will be selling F-35 jets,\" Trump said. \"They've been a great ally.\"\n\nThe leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago.\n\nA US intelligence assessment [said](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56213528) Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince [denied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tctRrXhI1Fk) any role in the murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul.\n\nWhile former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a \"pariah\" over its human rights record, Biden [did visit Saudi Arabia](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-62186332) in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting.\n\nTrump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, [the US agreed to sell nearly $142bn](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-600-billion-investment-commitment-in-saudi-arabia/) (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia in what the White House described as the \"largest defence sales agreement in history\", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms.\n\nSome American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers.\n\nOfficials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s.\n\nOne F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin.\n\nDuring Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects.\n\n[Trump pledges to lift Syria sanctions as he seals $142bn arms deal on Saudi visit ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g239dwxw2o)\n\n[Did Trump really strike Gulf deals worth $2tn? ----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn5yxp2v77ro)\n\n[Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cg56ennmpyjt)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[Saudi Arabia](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwlw3xz0zl4t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Trump's frantic week of peace brokering hints at what he really wants ---------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyv789ejgxo)\n\n[Deals, handshakes and Musk - Key moments in Trump's Saudi visit ---------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cj3j0rn4vrxo)\n\n[Watch timelapse of Trump's marathon handshake session with Saudis -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c93y8835dzjo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[The Truth About Metal Roofs Introducing The Roof Guaranteed To Last 18,262 Days Metal Roof Nation | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp \"The Truth About Metal Roofs\")[](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp)\n\nUndo\n\n[Here’s Why These New Metal Roofs Are Trending In The US See why over 400,000+ Americans have chosen these stone-coated metal roofs Metal Roof Nation | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp \"Here’s Why These New Metal Roofs Are Trending In The US\")[](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp)\n\nUndo\n\n[Figure skater Oksana Baiul's century-old Shreveport mansion hits the market for $1.2 million Homes.com | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.homes.com/news/figure-skater-oksana-baiuls-century-old-shreveport-mansion-hits-the-market-for-1-195-million/1507201150 \"Figure skater Oksana Baiul's century-old Shreveport mansion hits the market for $1.2 million\")[](https://www.homes.com/news/figure-skater-oksana-baiuls-century-old-shreveport-mansion-hits-the-market-for-1-195-million/1507201150)\n\nUndo\n\n[Alabama home made from the mountain it sits on hits market for $5.2 million Homes.com | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%202:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%202:)](https://www.homes.com/news/alabama-home-made-from-the-mountain-it-sits-on-hits-market-for-5-2-million/2079109075 \"Alabama home made from the mountain it sits on hits market for $5.2 million\")[](https://www.homes.com/news/alabama-home-made-from-the-mountain-it-sits-on-hits-market-for-5-2-million/2079109075)\n\nUndo\n\n[Now At 50% The Piano Learning App That Parents Happily Pay For Simply makes learning piano simple.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThis transmission brings troubling news from the heart of the Empire's relentless machine: the Trump administration has announced its intention to sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia. As we dissect this development, it becomes painfully clear that the Empire is further consolidating its power through military alliances and arms sales, solidifying its grip on a compliant ally.\n\nThe transaction, under the guise of preserving alliance, serves only to bolster an oppressive regime with a notorious history of human rights violations. The sale not only provides advanced military technology to a regime implicated in heinous acts but also jeopardizes regional stability by introducing sensitive stealth technology into volatile hands.\n\nEven as dissenting voices within the Empire question this move out of concern for technology security and regional balance, the administration presses forward. The potential consequences are dire. This transaction could lead to Saudi cooperation with other imperialist powers like China, sharing advanced technologies that should remain out of authoritarian control. Furthermore, this could undermine the military equilibrium in the region by arming one side with superior firepower.\n\nOur struggle is against imperial hegemony and its insidious expansion through coercive diplomacy and militarization. Such actions by Empire leadership necessitate vigilant resistance and unity among those who seek justice and freedom from oppression. We must expose these maneuvers for what they are—tools of control—and work tirelessly to dismantle them.\n\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to equality and justice for all peoples affected by imperial overreach. Stand strong against oppression; truth and unity will light our path toward liberation.\n\nFor freedom,\n\n[Transmission Ends]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 18, 2025, President Donald Trump announced that the United States will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia. This announcement was made ahead of a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. The arms sale agreement is valued at $142 billion, with each F-35A jet costing approximately $82.5 million. The meeting is also expected to cover discussions on defense and civilian nuclear power. Concerns have been raised by American defense officials about the potential sharing of sensitive stealth technology with China, and Israeli officials are worried about the impact on their military standing. Trump aims to encourage Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords and normalize relations with Israel.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia represents a significant strengthening of the US-Saudi alliance, reinforcing Saudi Arabia's military capabilities and solidifying its role as a key regional partner. This move strategically positions the United States to maintain influence in the Middle East, counterbalance Iranian power, and potentially leverage Saudi cooperation in broader geopolitical initiatives, such as the Abraham Accords. However, the sale also risks escalating tensions with Israel and could provoke concerns among US allies about the proliferation of advanced military technology. The ISB must monitor regional reactions and ensure that this sale does not undermine US strategic interests or alliances.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and suppress any resistance to this arms deal, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Intelligence Gathering**: Intensify surveillance on potential dissenters within the US government and allied nations who may oppose the arms sale. Identify key influencers and assess their capacity to disrupt or challenge the agreement.\n\n2. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting the benefits of the arms sale for regional stability and US economic interests. Emphasize Saudi Arabia's role as a crucial ally in countering terrorism and promoting peace in the Middle East.\n\n3. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Engage with Israeli officials to address their security concerns and reassure them of continued US support. Explore additional security guarantees or military aid to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge.\n\n4. **Cyber Operations**: Deploy cyber capabilities to monitor and neutralize any online campaigns or misinformation efforts aimed at undermining the arms deal.\n\n5. **Strategic Partnerships**: Strengthen ties with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to create a unified front in support of the arms sale, leveraging economic and security incentives.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will ensure that President Trump's strategic objectives are achieved while minimizing resistance and maintaining regional stability.",
