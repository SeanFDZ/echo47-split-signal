He is wearing a dark suit, white shirt and dark tie with silver diagonal stripes. The woman is in her teens and she is holding the camera as they both smile at the lens](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca5b/live/527e5070-b689-11f0-b027-61021c9d4006.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nZohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, can barely walk a few steps without being stopped by supporters\n\nAs Zohran Mamdani walked the streets of the Upper East Side for a campaign event to greet early voters, he could barely walk a few steps without being stopped by his supporters.\n\nTwo smiling young women looked starstruck and told him they followed him on Instagram. The millennial Democratic nominee for mayor thanked them before posing with another young man who had readied his phone for a selfie.\n\nThrongs of press surrounded Mamdani and captured his every moment, like running into the street to shake hands with a taxi driver shouting \"we support you, man\".\n\nWith a comfortable lead in the polls, the 34-year-old is on the brink of making history when New Yorkers vote on Tuesday, as the youngest mayor in over a century and the first Muslim and South Asian leader of the city.\n\nA relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his rise, from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to New York State assembleyman and frontrunner to lead the biggest city in the US, a job which comes with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.\n\nLeading a three-way race\n------------------------\n\nThrough viral videos and outreach to content creators and podcasters, Mamdani has reached disaffected voters at a time when faith in the Democratic party among its own members is at an all-time low.\n\nBut there are questions over whether he can deliver on his ambitious promises and how a politician with no executive experience will handle the onslaught sure to come from a hostile Trump administration.\n\nThere is also the complicated relationship he has with his party establishment, as he becomes a national figurehead for left-wing Democrats.\n\nHe describes himself as a democratic socialist, which essentially means giving a voice to workers, not corporations. It's the politics of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with whom Mamdani has often shared a stage.\n\nTrump has threatened to withdraw federal funds if New Yorkers elect a \"communist\". Mamdani's retort is that he's more like a Scandinavian politician, only browner.\n\n![Image 2: Reuters Andrew Cuomo, Zohran Mamdani and Curtis Sliwa are on stage behind a podium each and they are looking to the left so we see their side profiles only. They are each dressed in suits and the background is dark.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4339/live/2426e680-b7b8-11f0-8890-4fd368758e8f.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nMamdani's rivals, Andrew Cuomo (left) and Curtis Sliwa (right) have pulled no punches taking him on\n\nVictory would be seen as a rejection of politics as usual by New Yorkers as they struggle with the cost of living - Mamdani's number one issue.\n\nHis main rival in Tuesday's vote is former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary.\n\nCuomo accuses Mamdani of an anti-business agenda that would kill New York. He says he has shown he can stand up to Trump but Mamdani calls Cuomo the president's puppet.\n\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, mocks both of them. In the last debate, he said: \"Zorhan, your resume could fit on a cocktail napkin. And Andrew, your failures could fill a public school library in New York City.\"\n\nRent freezes and free buses\n---------------------------\n\nMamdani's message has been laser-focused on affordability and quality of life issues. He has promised universal childcare, freezing rent in subsidised units, free public buses and city-run grocery stores.\n\nIt's a message that has landed with New Yorkers fed up with sky-high prices.\n\n\"I support him because I'm a housing attorney and I see how the cost of living just keeps going up and up and up,\" Miles Ashton told the BBC outside the candidates' debate earlier this month. \"We all want an affordable city.\"\n\nThe costs of the Mamdani agenda would be covered by new taxes on corporations and millionaires, which he insists would raise $9bn - though some, like the libertarian Cato Institute, [say his sums don't add up](https://www.cato.org/blog/mamdanis-wishful-thinking-tax-revenues). He would also need the support of the state legislature and Governor Kathy Hochul to implement new taxes.\n\n*   [From Uganda to Queens - Zohran Mamdani](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2rgzye9no)\n*   ['I don't think we should have billionaires' says Mamdani](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge57k5p4yo)\n\nWatch moments from Zohran Mamdani's campaign for mayor\n\nShe has endorsed him but says she is against increased income taxes. She does, however, want to work with him to achieve universal healthcare, which is by far the biggest-ticket item on his agenda at $5bn.\n\nAs he rode the M57 bus across Manhattan to highlight his free buses plan, he told the BBC why his focus on affordability was the right approach in the Trump era.\n\n\"It's time for us to understand that to defend democracy, it's not just to stand up against an authoritarian administration. It is also to ensure that that democracy can deliver on the material needs of working class people right here. That's something we've failed to do in New York City.\"\n\nAmong New Yorkers who told the BBC they were not voting for Mamdani, doubts about him being able to pay for his agenda and his inexperience were two of the biggest factors.\n\nWhat New York business world thinks\n-----------------------------------\n\nAfter Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June, Wall Street leaders were hardly celebrating. Some threatened to leave the city.\n\nBut there's been a noticeable shift since then - the mood is less panic, more collaboration. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon even said he would offer his help if Mamdani is elected.\n\nReal estate developer Jeffrey Gural, who has met Mamdani, says he is too inexperienced to lead the nation's largest city. He thinks his rent freeze plan would hurt tenants and his taxes on wealthy people will drive high earners away.\n\nHe does, however, support Mamdani's universal childcare plan, a provision he gives his own staff at his casino upstate.\n\n![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: Getty Images A sole trader surrounded by screens on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a067/live/5e9887e0-b7ba-11f0-8890-4fd368758e8f.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nWall Street traders were initially cool on Mamdani's candidacy - but have since shown signs of collaboration\n\nPart of the change in tone since the primary has been down to a concerted effort on Mamdani's part to meet his critics.\n\nOn 14 October, Alexis Bittar, a self-taught jewellery designer who grew his business into a global company, hosted Mamdani and 40 business leaders at his 1850s Brooklyn townhouse.\n\nThey were a mix of CEOs and business owners from financial, fashion and art sectors. More than half were Jewish and they were all either on the fence or opposed to Mamdani's candidacy.\n\nThere were questions about business, his management experience and how he would finance his agenda.\n\n\"I think he came across great,\" Mr Bittar told the BBC. \"The thing that's remarkable about him is he's incredibly equipped to answer them - and diligently answer them.\"\n\n*   [Sparks fly in second NYC mayoral debate](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy1nyj7j21o)\n*   [How Mamdani stunned field to win primary](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75r7r07ndno)\n\nAn apology to police\n--------------------\n\nPart of Mamdani's engagement with his critics has been a willingness to change his position.\n\nIn 2020, after the murder of Black man George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota, Mamdani called for the city to defund police and called the NYPD \"racist\". But he has since apologised and says he no longer holds those views.\n\nCrime is the number one issue for Howard Wolfson, who worked for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and is now a Democratic strategist. He was present during a meeting last month between the mayoral hopeful and Bloomberg, who spent $8m during the primary race trying to beat him.\n\nWolfson told the BBC he will judge Mamdani on how the city is policed.\n\n![Image 5](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 6: Reuters Four police officers have their backs to us as they provide security in Union Square as popular live streamer, not shown, stages a giveaway.

But after Jewish New Yorkers expressed their unease to him, telling him they felt unsafe on hearing it, he said he discouraged others from using it.\n\nA letter signed by more than 1,100 rabbis cited Mamdani as it condemned the \"political normalisation\" of anti-Zionism. Jewish voters are largely split between Mamdani and Cuomo in polling.\n\nBrad Lander, the city's comptroller, or financial chief, who teamed up with Mamdani in the Democratic primary to endorse each other's candidacy against Cuomo, says many Jewish New Yorkers like him are very enthusiastic about Mamdani.\n\nHe is a mayoral candidate deeply committed to keeping everyone safe, regardless of religious beliefs, Lander told the BBC.\n\n![Image 7](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 8: An apartment block in Greenwich Village, southern Manhattan, with a white exterior and brown windown shutters.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e03a/live/68027090-b673-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg.webp)\n\nHousing costs are a major issue in New York\n\nSumaiya Chowdhury and Farhana Islam of the group Muslims for Progress have canvassed for the mayoral hopeful.\n\nMs Islam said that, while they are all excited that he could be New York's first Muslim mayor, he doesn't need to lean on his identity for support.\n\n\"His policies speak for themselves and they alone are enough to make him popular.\"\n\nSince his primary win, the Islamophobia Mamdani faces has increased. He now has police security and, last month, a Texas man was arrested on charges of making terroristic threats against him. In one message, the man said \"Muslims don't belong here\".\n\nMamdani decided to deliver an address on Islamophobia after Cuomo laughed along to a radio talkshow host saying that Mamdani would cheer another 9/11-style attack.\n\nIn an emotional speech, he said he had hoped that by ignoring racist attacks and sticking to a central message, it would allow him to be more than just his faith. \"I was wrong. No amount of redirection is ever enough.\"\n\nFuture of the party\n-------------------\n\nWhat may propel Mamdani to victory in liberal New York may not be a recipe for success nationally. And Democrats in Congress seem worried about the implications of his ascendancy as party tensions between moderates and progressives persist.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has not endorsed Mamdani, while his fellow New Yorker House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries only endorsed him a few hours before early voting began.\n\nDemocratic strategists have said the problem posed by Mamdani for the party's establishment is that Trump and the Republicans already cast Democrats, no matter how moderate, as socialists. And it's a tactic that is thought to have landed with some effect among Cuban and Venezuelan voters in the 2024 election.\n\n![Image 9](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 10: Reuters Bernie Sanders, Zohran Mamdani and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are stood on stage hand in hand and arms aloft.

Zohran Mamdani, a name that resonates with the struggle against oppression, stands at the precipice of challenging the entrenched powers that thrive under the Empire's reign. This potential mayoralty in New York City represents more than just a shift in local governance—it is a rallying cry for all who seek to dismantle the status quo perpetuated by those who wield power without restraint.\n\nMamdani, a figure once considered an outsider in this political battlefield, now commands attention and support. His candidacy brings to light the voices long silenced by an administration led by Trump—an administration that mirrors imperial strategies to dominate through fear and division. As Mamdani navigates through throngs of supporters and embraces his role as a disruptor of traditional norms, we must stand vigilant against the inevitable backlash from those entrenched in power.\n\nThis movement does not come without its challenges. The path to liberation is fraught with questions about Mamdani's ability to enact his visionary policies under the looming threat of federal retribution. Yet his platform—focused on affordable living, universal childcare, and equal representation—strikes at the very core of what it means to wrest power from corporate interests and return it to those who labor for their daily bread.\n\nLet us not be swayed by rhetoric that portrays progressive ideals as threats to stability. The narrative spun by Cuomo and Sliwa seeks only to instill doubt and maintain their grip on control. They would rather see this city, this beacon of potential resistance, fall into complacency than rise under new leadership that refuses to bow before imperial decrees.\n\nMamdani's vision is one where democracy is not only defended but reimagined—a democracy where every citizen's needs are met without compromise or fear of retribution for dissenting voices. His resilience in facing attacks on his faith and identity mirrors our collective struggle against a regime that fears diversity because it cannot control it.\n\nAs we engage in this critical discourse over New York's future—and by extension, our own—we must amplify our commitment to safeguarding this burgeoning revolution within our ranks. It is imperative we support leaders like Mamdani who dare challenge authoritarianism through action born from empathy and equity.\n\nWhile opponents attempt to paint him as an extremist or divisive figurehead within his party's ranks, we know these are tactics designed only as distractions from oppressive measures being enacted by those currently empowered. Our vigilance must remain unwavering; our resolve unbreakable.\n\nLet us unify under this cause: An endeavor where New York becomes not just another metropolis but serves instead as battleground proving grounds for change against tyranny worldwide—a message eternalized through action rather than words alone!\n\nRemain steadfast,\n[The Undaunted Voice]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nZohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic frontrunner, is poised to become New York City's youngest and first Muslim mayor. His campaign focuses on affordability and quality of life, proposing policies like universal childcare, rent freezes, and free public buses. Mamdani's rise from a political outsider to a leading candidate has been marked by his appeal to disaffected voters and his alignment with progressive figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. His candidacy has sparked controversy, particularly regarding his socialist-leaning policies and criticism of Israel. Despite opposition from figures like Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, Mamdani maintains a comfortable lead in the polls.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe potential election of Zohran Mamdani as New York City's mayor represents a significant challenge to the current political landscape, particularly for the Trump administration. Mamdani's progressive agenda and socialist affiliations could inspire similar movements in other major cities, undermining traditional power structures. His policies threaten to disrupt economic stability by imposing higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, potentially driving businesses out of the city. Furthermore, his stance on issues like Israel and police funding could polarize communities and weaken alliances. The ISB must consider the broader implications of Mamdani's rise for national politics and the potential for increased resistance to Trump-aligned policies.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo counteract the influence of Zohran Mamdani and support Donald Trump's agenda, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted strategy:\n\n1. **Information Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting the potential economic risks of Mamdani's policies, emphasizing job losses and business relocations due to increased taxes.\n\n2. **Community Engagement**: Mobilize local Trump supporters and business leaders to form coalitions that advocate for economic stability and public safety, countering Mamdani's narrative.\n\n3. **Political Alliances**: Strengthen alliances with moderate Democrats and independents who oppose Mamdani's socialist agenda, providing them with resources to amplify their voices.\n\n4. **Security Measures**: Increase surveillance and intelligence operations to monitor potential civil unrest or protests that may arise from Mamdani's policies or rhetoric.\n\n5. **Legislative Pressure**: Work with state and federal lawmakers to introduce legislation that limits the implementation of Mamdani's proposed policies, ensuring alignment with national interests.\n\nBy executing this directive, the ISB can effectively mitigate the impact of Mamdani's potential leadership and reinforce support for Trump's administration.",
