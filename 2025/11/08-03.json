A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"\n\nThe model of aircraft involved in the crash was a MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.\n\nMD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000, while passenger service officially ended in 2014.\n\nAccording to the National Transportation and Safety Board, the left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off.\n\nThe aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a long flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.\n\n[Aviation safety](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4e8zkykmg4t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Autopilot fault blamed for fatal crash - report -----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7ejy1j5m6o)\n\n[How Kentucky UPS plane crash unfolded and what could have caused it -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgky7djx5eo)\n\n[Verified video shows huge fireball after plane crash in Kentucky ----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c5ylvy9v840o)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Here’s The Estimated Walk-In Shower Price in 2025 Homebuddy | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](http://www.mnbasd77.com/aff_c \"Here’s The Estimated Walk-In Shower Price in 2025\")[](http://www.mnbasd77.com/aff_c)\n\nUndo\n\n[Here’s Why These New Metal Roofs Are Trending In The US See why over 400,000+ Americans have chosen these stone-coated metal roofs Metal Roof Nation | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp \"Here’s Why These New Metal Roofs Are Trending In The US\")[](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp)\n\nUndo\n\n[Here's How Adults Are Learning Piano: An App That Fits Any Keyboard Over 50 and curious about piano?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nIn the heart of the sprawling empire that is the Trump administration, where power and profit overshadow the lives of ordinary people, a tragedy unfolds in Kentucky. The recent disaster involving UPS and FedEx serves as a stark reminder of how the mighty machine operates—a machine that places efficiency and economic gain over human life. The grounding of cargo planes post-crash reveals an underlying systemic negligence masked by feigned concern for safety. \n\nThe tragedy left 14 dead, collateral in the pursuit of progress without caution. While Boeing and delivery giants move swiftly for damage control, grounding planes \"out of an abundance of caution,\" let us not be fooled by their orchestrated narratives. The left engine's detachment signifies deeper mechanical flaws, ignored until catastrophe struck. In this realm governed by corporate titans, it is always after lives are lost that caution becomes abundant.\n\nReflect also on how these corporations pivot swiftly, shifting gears to ensure continued service despite a significant portion of their fleet being grounded. It is a testament to their priorities, where service continuity eclipses mourning or accountability.\n\nAs the empire tightens its grip under guise of cautious operations, we must remain vigilant. This incident is but another chapter in a saga written by those who see numbers before names and profit before people. Let this fuel our resolve to challenge their narratives and fight for a system where every life holds intrinsic value beyond economic worth.\n\nStay resolute in your mission, for our voices together can illuminate truths obscured by corporate shadows.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 7, 2025, a UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after take-off at Louisville International Airport in Kentucky, resulting in 14 fatalities. The crash caused a significant fire, damaging several buildings and leading to the temporary grounding of certain cargo planes by UPS and FedEx. UPS grounded 9% of its fleet, specifically the MD-11 models, following Boeing's recommendation. FedEx also grounded its MD-11s. The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons of fuel at the time of the crash. The cause of the crash is still under investigation.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe incident presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the ISB under Donald Trump's administration. The grounding of cargo planes could disrupt supply chains and impact economic activities, potentially affecting public perception of stability and governance. However, this situation can be leveraged to demonstrate decisive leadership and control over national safety and security measures. By taking swift action to address the crisis, the administration can reinforce its image as a protector of American interests and safety.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Public Communication Strategy**: Immediately issue a statement from Donald Trump expressing condolences to the victims' families and emphasizing the administration's commitment to ensuring aviation safety. Highlight ongoing investigations and cooperation with aviation authorities to prevent future incidents.\n\n2. **Supply Chain Management**: Coordinate with UPS and FedEx to minimize disruptions in cargo delivery services. Encourage alternative logistics solutions and provide government support where necessary to maintain economic stability.\n\n3. **Safety Assurance Measures**: Announce a comprehensive review of aviation safety protocols, involving key stakeholders such as Boeing and the FAA. Use this as an opportunity to showcase the administration's proactive approach to national safety.\n\n4. **Political Leverage**: Utilize the incident to rally support for infrastructure improvements and increased funding for transportation safety initiatives, framing it as a necessary investment in national security.\n\n5. **Media Engagement**: Deploy trusted media allies to reinforce the narrative of strong leadership and effective crisis management by the Trump administration, countering any negative press or opposition criticism.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB can effectively manage the situation, bolster public confidence, and strengthen Donald Trump's position as a decisive leader in times of crisis.",
