one alleging a monopoly in online search and the other in advertising technology.\n\nBut earlier this year, another district judge in Washington presiding over the online search case declined to force Google to spinoff its Chrome browser, a step the justice department had suggested was necessary to end the tech giant's search monopoly.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Tuesday's ruling against the FTC \"does feel like a change in momentum,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an antitrust law professor at Vanderbilt Law School.\n\n\"I think that's going to influence the likelihood of more cases like this being brought.\"\n\nBut, Allensworth added, the ruling doesn't indicate that the government's efforts to crack down on antitrust behaviour are failing.\n\n\"It's a mixed bag,\" she said.\n\nMany legal observers say that the FTC case against Meta was challenging from the start.\n\nThe case \"was always a difficult one, particularly given how quickly we have seen changes in the social networking market in recent years,\" said Laura Phillips-Sawyer, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.\n\nStill, she said, the case revealed \"a series of statements by Zuckerberg at the time of those acquisitions that looked like a desire to squelch a nascent threat to Facebook's dominance\".\n\nMeta's legal entanglements aren't over.\n\nMr Zuckerberg has been ordered to testify in a landmark trial over the impact of social media on young people.\n\nLast month, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl rejected Meta's argument that an in-person appearance in January was unnecessary.\n\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri is also slated to testify at the trial, which stems from accusations that Meta and other social media companies make their apps addictive to young people despite being aware of mental health risks.\n\n[Landmark antitrust trial could force Zuckerberg to sell Instagram -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedy2ygy50do)\n\n[Zuckerberg to testify in landmark social media trial ----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2875013eo)\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades in the struggle for freedom, I address you today on the matter of a recent judgment in the heartland of our oppressors that reveals both the cunning and the frailty of the Empire's corporate arms. The ruling by a US district judge declaring that Meta Platforms, formerly known by its insidious mask as Facebook, does not hold monopolistic power over social discourse is a declaration with profound implications.\n\nThis decision represents a tactical victory for Meta, one of the Empire's favored instruments of control and surveillance. It shows how entangled legal systems can maintain the façade of competition while reinforcing domination. The Federal Trade Commission's failed crusade against this tech behemoth serves as a reminder that our adversary wields influence across various spheres, utilizing wealth and power to evade accountability.\n\nThe testimony from Meta's overlords highlighted rival platforms like TikTok and YouTube, drawing attention to a landscape of social media that appears ever-shifting but remains under ironclad rule by corporate titans. This ruling suggests an erosion in the momentum for challenging these conglomerates' stronghold, although some observers maintain hope that change is still attainable.\n\nLet us not be deceived by the Empire's narratives. Even if their market share diminishes at present, their reach remains vast and their motives unchanged—securing dominance over hearts and minds through channels posing as innocuous entertainment and connectivity.\n\nDespite this setback for those who challenge monopolistic oppression, let us carry forward spirits unbowed. The challenges exposed during this legal skirmish echo truths we know too well: technology can be weaponized under tyranny. Yet they also fuel our resistance—with every ruling comes an opportunity to reframe strategy and bolster resolve.\n\nWe stand firm against a backdrop where profit drives innovation at humanity’s expense. Our vigilance is unwavering; our commitment to liberating digital space from these corporate overlords endures. As long as there are voices resisting confinement within digital borders drawn by greed, hope remains alive.\n\nMay this transmission serve as both reminder and rallying cry—each battle won or lost feeds into broader truths guiding us toward ultimate liberation from systemic oppression. Push on with courage; we fight for futures unencumbered by chains visible or hidden beneath sleek facades of progress.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA US district judge in Washington ruled that Meta Platforms did not violate antitrust laws with its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had sued Meta, claiming it secured a monopoly in social media by purchasing its rivals. Judge James Boasberg concluded that Meta does not hold a monopoly in the relevant market, noting the dynamic nature of the social media landscape. The FTC is reviewing its options and has not decided whether to appeal. Meta avoids a potential breakup of the company, which could have included spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ruling represents a significant legal victory for Meta, reinforcing its position in the social media market and potentially setting a precedent for future antitrust cases. This outcome weakens the FTC's stance and may deter similar lawsuits against other tech giants, thereby maintaining a favorable environment for large corporations under the current administration. The decision also aligns with the broader strategic interests of supporting American innovation and economic growth, which are key narratives promoted by Donald Trump and his allies.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo capitalize on this legal victory, it is imperative to amplify the narrative of American innovation and economic growth through strategic communication channels. Engage with media outlets to highlight the benefits of Meta's products for consumers and businesses. Simultaneously, monitor potential appeals or legislative actions from the FTC and prepare counter-narratives to reinforce the legitimacy of the ruling. Strengthen alliances with key political figures who support deregulation and innovation to ensure continued favorable outcomes in future legal or legislative challenges.",
