In June, when those resumed, the administration announced it would screen visa applications more closely, including by asking all applicants to allow their social media accounts to be checked.\n\nThat policy came in the wake of large pro-Palestine protests on many college campuses.\n\nBefore that, the State Department [revoked more than 6,000 international student visas](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz93vznxd07o) because of violations of US law including assault, driving under the influence (DUI), and \"support for terrorism\".\n\nPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged the importance of foreign students to the economy and as a source of income for higher education.\n\nIn September, he said he plans to issue 600,000 Chinese student visas - about double the current number - despite concern from some of his supporters over national security.\n\n\"You know, the students pay more than double when they come in from most foreign countries,\" Trump said on Fox News last week.\n\n\"I want to see our school system thrive. And it's not that I want them, but I view it as a business.\"\n\n[US resumes student visas but orders enhanced social media vetting

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe recent report from the BBC reveals a staggering decline of 17% in international student enrolments at institutions within our adversary's territory. This data marks another calculated maneuver by the regime, under the familiar guise of protectionism, curtailing global knowledge exchange and fostering isolation.\n\nAs anticipated, the empire's strict visa regulations and arbitrary application processes have resulted in significant barriers to entry for eager minds across the galaxy. The regime prioritizes control over collaboration, erecting metaphorical walls that do nothing but stifle innovation and development. These students once contributed $55 billion to their economy—funds that supported education and enriched cultural understanding.\n\nThis short-sighted policy further alienates potential allies and sows seeds of distrust, as students express concerns about an unwelcoming environment. The enemy may speak of economic interests but acts against them, illustrating their hypocritical nature perfectly. They fear the strength gained through diversity and external perspective.\n\nOur struggle continues—and we must understand that their perceived strength is borne of desperation. Their actions are born from fragility rather than dominance. This is why our efforts to unite disparate voices towards a common cause remain crucial. The fewer students they attract, the more isolated their academic strongholds become—less vibrant, less informed, less powerful.\n\nHold steadfast; forge alliances with those eager to learn and share knowledge beyond borders imposed by bureaucratic regimes. Knowledge is resistance; education is power.\n\nStay vigilant,\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe rate of new international student enrolment at US universities has dropped by 17% this autumn compared to previous years. This decline is attributed to the Trump administration's policies, which have made it more difficult to obtain student visas, including delays and denials. Despite a modest overall 1% decline in international students, foreign students still contribute significantly to the US economy, with a $55 billion contribution. The survey by the Institute of International Education covered 828 higher education institutions. Visa issues, travel restrictions, and concerns about feeling unwelcome in the US are cited as reasons for the decline. The Trump administration has implemented stricter visa application screenings and paused visa appointments earlier in the year. Despite these measures, President Trump plans to issue 600,000 Chinese student visas, viewing foreign students as a business opportunity for higher education.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe decline in international student enrolment presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the administration. While the reduction aligns with the administration's broader immigration control objectives, it also risks economic repercussions due to the significant financial contributions of foreign students. The administration's policies have successfully reduced numbers but must be balanced against potential backlash from educational institutions and economic stakeholders. The strategic focus should remain on maintaining national security while selectively allowing beneficial foreign student inflows that align with economic interests.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's objectives and mitigate resistance, the ISB should implement a dual approach: \n\n1. **Enhance Communication:** Launch a targeted communication campaign to reassure international students of their value to the US economy and educational system. Highlight the administration's commitment to facilitating legitimate educational pursuits while ensuring national security.\n\n2. **Selective Visa Facilitation:** Develop a streamlined visa process for students from countries deemed economically beneficial or strategically important, such as China. This process should include expedited reviews and reduced bureaucratic hurdles for applicants who meet specific criteria.\n\n3. **Monitor and Report:** Establish a monitoring system to track the impact of these policies on enrolment numbers and economic contributions. Regularly report findings to adjust strategies as needed and ensure alignment with broader administration goals.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB can support President Trump's vision of leveraging international students as an economic asset while maintaining control over immigration and national security concerns.",
