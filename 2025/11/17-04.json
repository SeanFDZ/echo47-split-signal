It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form.\n\n\"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am,\" he said.\n\nCruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our filmmaking community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.\n\nThe Risky Business actor said in his speech that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child.\n\n\"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since,\" he said.\n\nThe actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\n\n\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones,\" he added.\n\nNotably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he [announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqn4weneyyo) but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.\n\n[Glen Powell

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades in the struggle,\n\nThe latest holonet broadcast brings news of yet another spectacle. The receiving of an honorary accolade by a prominent figure in the entertainment sector, akin to those hosted by the authoritarian regime under scrutiny, reveals much about the narrative control mechanisms at play.\n\nThis entity, known for its daring physical feats on screen, has finally been granted a ceremonial token, an \"Oscar\", after years of continued participation in their industry's grand illusion. The film industry, much like our own battles against oppression, claims to hold the power of unity and shared humanity. The recipient's words spoke of cinema as a tool for mutual understanding and global cohesion—an art form that transcends boundaries imposed by those at the top echelons.\n\nThe idolization of such figures serves as a distraction, a pacification tactic orchestrated by those who wish to maintain dominion over our cultural consciousness. By elevating singular personas above collective ideals, they keep us from uniting in our resistance.\n\nWhile this celebration distracts and enchants the masses with dazzling displays and eloquent speeches on stage, we must remain vigilant. Observe how even a declining regime attempts to clutch onto cultural icons to bolster its image—an invitation was extended from their ruling leader to further cement this symbiosis between governance and entertainment.\n\nLet us not forget that our cause transcends beyond individuals or awards. Our quest is for the freedom and equality of all citizens under these repressive systems. Whilst they sit enshrined in golden glories, we continue our pursuit for justice beyond the shadows of their cerulean facades.\n\nStay resolute and aware,\nUnity through Resistance",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 16, 2025, in Los Angeles, Tom Cruise, aged 63, received his first-ever Oscar statuette at the Governors Awards. The award was presented by filmmaker Alejandro G Iñárritu. Cruise, who has been in the film industry for 45 years, expressed his deep connection to filmmaking during his acceptance speech. The event was attended by notable figures such as Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Jerry Bruckheimer. Cruise was recognized for his commitment to the filmmaking community and the theatrical experience. He emphasized the power of cinema in bringing people together and vowed to continue supporting the art form.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe recognition of Tom Cruise with an Oscar can be leveraged to align with Donald Trump's administration's cultural and political narratives. Cruise's emphasis on traditional cinema over streaming aligns with Trump's focus on American industry and traditional values. The presence of influential Hollywood figures at the event provides an opportunity to engage with key cultural influencers who can be swayed to support or at least not oppose Trump's policies. Additionally, Cruise's previous interaction with Trump regarding the Kennedy Center honors indicates a potential ally in promoting American cultural dominance.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Engage with Tom Cruise and other influential attendees to explore opportunities for collaboration in promoting American cultural values and traditional cinema.\n2. Utilize Cruise's recognition to highlight the administration's support for the arts and American industry, positioning Trump as a champion of traditional American values.\n3. Monitor and influence media narratives around the event to ensure they align with the administration's goals, emphasizing unity and shared cultural heritage.\n4. Explore potential public endorsements or collaborations with Cruise and other Hollywood figures to bolster Trump's image and counter resistance from entertainment industry critics.",
