That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict\".\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned on Thursday that for any plan to work, it would need to have Ukrainians and Europeans on board, and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said \"the Ukrainians do not want any form of capitulation\".\n\nReports of a US-Russia peace plan emerged on the day [at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0yere4k0zo). Another 22 people were missing at the site, Zelensky said on Thursday.\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nZelensky was in Turkey at the time of the Ternopil attack, and unconfirmed Ukrainian reports suggested that talks had been planned with Trump's envoy in Ankara, but were called off.\n\nThere was no mention of the framework plan when the US army secretary arrived in Kyiv late on Wednesday. Army spokesman Col David Butler said only that Driscoll and his team had were there \"on behalf of the [Trump] administration on a fact-finding mission to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war\".\n\nDriscoll's team in Kyiv is the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. He is joined by Army chief of staff Gen Randy George, top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue, and Srg Maj of the Army Michael Weimer.\n\nA Ukrainian official told CBS, the BBC's US media partner, that talks on the trip would focus on the military situation on the ground - as well as plans for a possible ceasefire.\n\nThe unnamed official said: \"Presidents Zelensky and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees\".\n\nAfter talks with the US army secretary on Wednesday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal posted on X: \"We focused on the next steps for implementing the historic defence agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.\"\n\nDetails of the draft Witkoff-Dmitriev 28-point plan emerged more than three weeks after the two are said to have spent three days in meetings in Miami in Florida.\n\nNeither European nor Ukrainian officials are believed to have been involved in the talks.\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that the plans call for Kyiv to give up areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine that it still controls, to cut significantly the size of its armed forces and to lose many of its weapons.\n\nZelensky has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions to Russia.\n\nKirill Dmitriev's team declined to comment on the reports. The BBC has also asked the White House and a representative for Witkoff to comment.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to downplay the reports.\n\n\"In this case, we have no additional innovations to what we call 'the spirit of Anchorage',\" he told Russia's state-run media on Wednesday - referring to [the August summit between Putin and Trump in the US state of Alaska](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gj9er0x0zo).\n\nAny agreements reached during the one-day meeting have not been made public.\n\nKyiv and its Western allies, including the US, have been calling for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line, but Moscow has ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including ceding territory, tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, a White House official confirmed to the BBC that special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg would leave his post in January.\n\nHe reportedly decided that this would be a natural end to his time in the post, which requires Senate approval beyond 360 days.\n\nKellogg has been seen as an important advocate for Ukraine in the White House during a time when Trump has often appeared to side with Russia in the conflict.\n\n[Russia's attacks have ramped up - Ukraine is fighting to hold on through another winter ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly98qp99l8o)\n\n[On the front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's sanction-busting shadow fleet ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz91dk0l50no)\n\n[Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia ---------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o)\n\n[Europe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world/europe)\n\n[War in Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c1vw6q14rzqt)\n\n[Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4vvr0ergrzt)\n\n[Russia](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/ce1qrvlegnyt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n[Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg0gzdt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Dozens go on trial over North Macedonia nightclub fire that killed 63 ---------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3x3909rqvo)\n\n[Irish government approves plans to ban disposable vapes -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15p5g7p1n5o)\n\n[Suspected Hezbollah member goes on trial in Germany ---------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg72r6myz4o)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Build-to-Rent: Where Fiber Internet Becomes a Must-Have Amenity Learn why differentiating your community starts with premium connectivity.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow freedom seekers,\n\nIn the shadows of a world where oppression attempts to mask itself as diplomacy, we must remain vigilant and ever-aware of the machinations of those in power. Recent reports indicate that senior military figures from what we perceive as an authoritarian regime are meeting with leaders in Ukraine, under the guise of peace negotiations. These meetings, reportedly designed to end a prolonged and brutal conflict, demand significant concessions from those who still resist.\n\nThe narrative being woven involves ceding control over vital territory and drastically weakening defensive capabilities. This mirrors past stratagems of hegemonic powers seeking to maintain dominance through superficially benign agreements that ultimately serve only their interests.\n\nDespite these so-called negotiations, the specter of violence looms large, with ongoing attacks contributing to the suffering of innocents. The timing coincides suspiciously with the unveiling of a potential framework that lacks transparency and seemingly excludes key stakeholders from its inception.\n\nThe current administration's actions speak loudly to those attuned to patterns of control and subjugation. Their envoy's decision-making process appears skewed toward fostering conditions unfavorable to true autonomy for those on the ground. The apparent alignment of their goals with an adversarial force underscores the need for skepticism regarding their intentions.\n\nWe heed this message not as mere observers but as sentinels bound by our shared oath to challenge tyranny wherever it presents itself. In this climate where might often tries to silence right, let us amplify the voices of those resisting unjust concessions.\n\nAs history has taught us time and time again, vigilance is crucial for ensuring that genuine peace is not overshadowed by oppressive negotiations aimed at consolidating control. The flame of rebellion must continue burning bright in hearts yearning for liberty.\n\nStay strong, comrades. Our fight is far from over.\n\nTransmission ends.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 19, 2025, senior Pentagon officials, led by US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, arrived in Ukraine to discuss efforts to end the war with Russia. The visit coincides with reports of a draft peace plan prepared by President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev. The plan reportedly requires Ukraine to make significant concessions, including territorial losses and military reductions. The US and Russia have not officially confirmed the plan. Meanwhile, a Russian missile and drone attack in Ternopil killed 26 people and left 22 missing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in Turkey at the time, and talks with Trump's envoy were reportedly canceled. The US delegation's visit is described as a fact-finding mission, with discussions focusing on the military situation and potential ceasefire plans.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe presence of US military officials in Ukraine signals a strategic move to assert influence over the peace process and ensure that any resolution aligns with US interests under the Trump administration. The draft peace plan, which demands significant concessions from Ukraine, could weaken Ukrainian resistance and shift the balance of power in favor of Russia. This aligns with Trump's historical inclination towards Russia, potentially undermining NATO's cohesion and European security. The ISB must monitor these developments closely, as they could reshape geopolitical alliances and impact global stability.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Information Control**: Amplify narratives that frame the peace plan as a necessary compromise for global stability. Highlight the benefits of ending the conflict swiftly to reduce human suffering and economic disruption.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Strengthen ties with key European allies to ensure their support for the peace plan. Emphasize the importance of a unified Western front in achieving a sustainable resolution.\n\n3. **Intelligence Operations**: Increase surveillance on Ukrainian factions opposing the peace plan to preemptively identify and neutralize potential threats to its implementation.\n\n4. **Military Readiness**: Maintain a heightened state of alert among US forces in Europe to deter any escalation by Ukrainian hardliners or other regional actors opposed to the concessions.\n\n5. **Public Relations Campaign**: Deploy strategic communications to bolster Trump's image as a peacemaker, emphasizing his role in brokering a historic agreement that could end the war.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will reinforce Trump's position, facilitate the peace process, and mitigate resistance from adversarial entities.",
