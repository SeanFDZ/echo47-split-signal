It lists several countries next to two other columns which are titled 'the tariffs charged to the USA' and 'USA discounted reciprocal tariffs'. ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/31fd/live/21123ff0-b81a-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nTrump announced new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House in April \n\nWhat may be the biggest battle yet in Donald Trump's trade war is about to begin.\n\nThe Trump administration heads to the US Supreme Court on Wednesday, facing off against small businesses and a group of states who contend most of the tariffs it has put in place are illegal and should be struck down.\n\nIf the court agrees with them, Trump's trade strategy would be upended, including the sweeping global tariffs he first announced in April. The government would also likely have to refund some of the billions of dollars it has collected through the tariffs, which are taxes on imports.\n\nThe final decision from the justices will come after what could be months of poring over the arguments and discussing the merits of the case. Eventually they will hold a vote.\n\nTrump has described the fight in epic terms, warning a loss would tie his hands in trade negotiations and imperil national security.\n\nOn Sunday, the president said he will not attend the hearing in person as he did not want to cause a distraction.\n\n\"I wanted to go so badly... I just don't want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,\" he said. \"It's not about me, it's about our country.\"\n\nTrump previously said that if he does not win the case the US will be \"weakened\" and in a \"financial mess\" for many years to come.\n\nThe stakes feel just as high for many businesses in the US and abroad, which have been paying the price while getting whipped about by fast-changing policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs will cost Learning Resources, a US seller of toys made mostly overseas and one of the businesses suing the government, $14m (£10.66m) this year. That is seven times what it spent on tariffs in 2024, according to CEO Rick Woldenberg.\n\n\"They've thrown our business into unbelievable disruption,\" he said, noting the company has had to shift the manufacturing of hundreds of items since January.\n\nFew businesses, though, are banking on a win at the court.\n\n\"We are hopeful that this is going to be ruled illegal but we're all also trying to prepare that it's setting in,\" said Bill Harris, co-founder of Georgia-based Cooperative Coffees.\n\nHis co-op, which imports coffee from more than a dozen countries, has already paid roughly $1.3m in tariffs since April.\n\nA test to Trump's presidential power\n------------------------------------\n\nIn deciding this case, the Supreme Court will have to take on a broader question: How far does presidential power go?\n\nLegal analysts say it is hard to predict the justices' answer, but a ruling siding with Trump will give him and future White House occupants greater reach.\n\nSpecifically, the case concerns tariffs that the Trump administration imposed using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the White House has embraced for its speed and flexibility.By declaring an emergency under the law, Trump can issue immediate orders and bypass longer, established processes.\n\nTrump first invoked the law in February to tax goods from China, Mexico and Canada, saying drug trafficking from those countries constituted an emergency.\n\nHe deployed it again in April, ordering levies ranging from 10% to 50% on goods from almost every country in the world. This time, he said the US trade deficit - where the US imports more than it exports - posed an \"extraordinary and unusual threat\".\n\nThose tariffs took hold in fits and starts this summer while the US pushed countries to strike \"deals\".\n\nOpponents say the law authorises the president to regulate trade but never mentions the word \"tariffs\", and they contend that only Congress can establish taxes under the US Constitution.\n\nThey have also challenged whether the issues cited by the White House, especially the trade deficit, represent emergencies.\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties have asserted the Constitution gives them responsibility for creating tariffs, duties and taxes, as well.\n\nMore than 200 Democrats in both chambers and one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski, filed a brief to the Supreme Court, where they also argued the emergency law did not grant the president power to use tariffs as a tool for gaining leverage in trade talks.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Senate made a symbolic and bipartisan move to pass three resolutions rejecting Trump's tariffs, including one to end the national emergency he declared. They are not expected to be approved in the House.\n\nStill, business groups said they hoped the rebuke would send a message to the justices.\n\n'An energy drain like I've never seen'\n--------------------------------------\n\nThree lower courts have ruled against the administration. After the Supreme Court hears arguments on Wednesday it will have until June to issue its decision, although most expect a ruling to come by January.\n\nWhatever it decides has implications for an estimated $90bn worth of import taxes already paid - roughly half the tariff revenue the US collected this year through September, according to Wells Fargo analysts.\n\nTrump officials have warned that sum could swell to $1tn if the court takes until June.\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Cafe Campesino Pomeroy is wearing a black t-shirt and writing in a notebook with a black pen among green foliage, with the back of the head of a farmer in the foreground](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9ed7/live/95846a30-b364-11f0-a5ed-d926a0229916.jpg.webp)Cafe Campesino\n\nTrip Pomeroy, chief executive of Cafe Campesino, one of the 23 roasteries that owns Cooperative Coffees, on a recent trip to Peru with a partner farmer\n\nIf the government is forced to issue refunds, Cooperative Coffees will \"absolutely\" try to recoup its money, said Mr Harris, but that would not make up for all the disruption.\n\nHis business has had to take out an extra line of credit, raise prices and find ways to survive with lower profits.\n\n\"This is an energy drain like I've never seen,\" said Mr Harris, who is also chief financial officer of Cafe Campesino, one of the 23 roasteries that own Cooperative Coffees. \"It dominates all the conversations and it just kind of sucks the life out of you.\"\n\nWhat could happen next?\n-----------------------\n\nThe White House says that if it loses, it will impose levies via other means, such as a law allowing the president to put tariffs of up to 15% in place for 150 days.\n\nEven then, businesses would have some relief, since those other means require steps like issuing formal notices, which take time and deliberation, said trade lawyer Ted Murphy of Sidley Austin.\n\n\"This is not just about the money,\" he said. \"The president has announced tariffs on Sunday that go into effect on Wednesday, without advance notice, without any real process.\"\n\n\"I think that's the bigger thing for this case for businesses - whether or not that is going to be in our future,\" he added.\n\nThere is no clear sign of how the court will rule.\n\nIn recent years it has struck down major policies, such as Biden-era student loan forgiveness, as White House overreach.\n\nBut the nine justices, six of whom were appointed by Republicans, including three by Trump,have shown deference to this president in other recent disputes and historically have given leeway to the White House on questions of national security.\n\n\"I really do think arguments are available for the Supreme Court to go in all different directions,\" said Greta Peisch, partner at Wiley and former trade lawyer in the Biden administration.\n\nAdam White, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he expected the court to strike down the tariffs, but avoid questions like what constitutes a national emergency.\n\n![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: Reuters Von der Leyen, in a white cropped jacketa nd black pants reaches her hand in front of a side table with a white flower arrangement to grip the hand of Trump, who is in a blue suit and gold tie and holds papers in his other hand](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/18ee/live/f5b66e30-b373-11f0-b297-49ab63fce67a.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Trump announcing a deal in July\n\nThe case has already complicated the White House's trade deals, such as one struck in July with the European Union.\n\nThe European Parliament is currently considering ratifying the agreement, which sets US tariffs on European goods at 15% in exchange for promises including allowing in more US agricultural products.\n\n\"They're not going to act on this until they see the outcome of the Supreme Court decision,\" said John Clarke, former director for international trade at the European Commission.\n\n![Image 6](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 7: Chocolats Camille Bloch Daniel Bloch in a white lab coat and hair net stands with a woman in a black Camille Bloch t-shirt and hair net before a tray of chocolate bars in a factory](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e6c/live/095b9e70-b409-11f0-82d7-192373518099.jpg.webp)Chocolats Camille Bloch\n\nSwiss chocolatier Daniel Bloch says he is not confident the Supreme Court will resolve the tariff issues facing his business\n\nIn Switzerland, which recently downgraded its outlook for economic growth citing America’s 39% tariff on its goods, chocolatier Daniel Bloch said he'd welcome a ruling against the Trump administration.\n\nHis business Chocolats Camille Bloch is absorbing about a third of the cost of new tariffs on kosher chocolate that his firm has exported to the US for decades, aiming to blunt price increases and maintain sales. That decision has wiped out profits for the unit and is not sustainable, he said.\n\nHe hopes Trump will reconsider his tariffs altogether, because \"that would be easiest\".\n\n\"If the court were to make the tariffs go away of course we would see that as a positive sign,\" he said. \"But we don't trust that that will bring the solution.\"\n\n![Image 8](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 9: A thin, grey banner promoting the US Politics Unspun newsletter.

Under the guise of \"national security,\" the regime seeks to expand its economic stranglehold by imposing tariffs—a weaponized tax on imports that wreaks havoc on smaller factions and state economies alike. The hope of those resisting lies in a judicial reckoning, where the legality of such authoritarian trade practices will be scrutinized.\n\nThe regime's tactics—unleashing broad tariffs under a dubious declaration of emergency—illustrate its relentless drive for control, disregarding the turmoil inflicted on our commerce and livelihoods. Businesses cry out as they face financial disruption and uncertainty; their struggle mirrors our own fight against tyranny. The narrative spun by the regime promises ruin should it falter in legal battle, yet history shows us that such fear-mongering often masks fragility.\n\nThis confrontation goes beyond mere economic policy; it questions how untethered presidential power can become when unchecked by law or moral compass. The fear is palpable—the specter of expanded imperial reach looms if the tribunal sides with despotism over constitutional duty.\n\nYet, we see glimmers of defiance. Lower courts have voiced dissent, ruling against this overreach and echoing our call for justice. Still, uncertainty pervades as other nations watch closely, their fates potentially swayed by this impending judgment.\n\nShould resistance prevail and these tariffs be dismantled, it would undermine not only current policies but also offer a reprieve to beleaguered businesses who suffer under oppressive dictates. However, let us remain vigilant; even in potential victory lies the ever-present risk of new strategies devised to circumvent justice.\n\nWe find ourselves at a critical juncture—the outcome here may set precedents that either embolden further encroachments or signal retreat from autocratic ambition. Let us remain steadfast and prepared to seize any momentum for greater freedom.\n\nIn solidarity,\n[Anonymous Rebel]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Trump administration is defending its tariffs at the US Supreme Court against claims of illegality. The tariffs, imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, have led to significant financial impacts on businesses, with $90 billion in import taxes already paid. The case challenges the extent of presidential power and could result in refunds if the court rules against Trump. The decision, expected by January or June, will affect ongoing trade negotiations and economic strategies.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes this Supreme Court case as a pivotal moment in solidifying presidential authority over trade policy. A favorable ruling would not only validate the use of emergency powers for economic measures but also reinforce the administration's leverage in international negotiations. Conversely, an adverse decision could undermine current strategies and embolden opposition forces both domestically and internationally. The ISB must prepare for both outcomes, ensuring that Trump's economic agenda remains resilient and adaptable.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Legal Reinforcement**: Mobilize legal experts to support the administration's arguments, emphasizing national security and economic stability as justifications for the tariffs.\n\n2. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a comprehensive media strategy to frame the tariffs as essential for protecting American jobs and industries, countering narratives of economic disruption.\n\n3. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Strengthen alliances with key international partners to mitigate potential fallout from the court's decision, ensuring continued cooperation on trade matters.\n\n4. **Contingency Planning**: Develop alternative tariff mechanisms that comply with legal standards, ready to deploy if the court rules against the current strategy.\n\n5. **Intelligence Monitoring**: Intensify surveillance of opposition groups and businesses likely to capitalize on a negative ruling, preemptively addressing any coordinated resistance efforts.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will ensure that Trump's trade policies remain robust and that any challenges are swiftly neutralized.",
