He served four months in prison and agreed to step down as the chief executive of Binance, the crypto exchange he co-founded.\n\nHis companies have partnered with firms linked to Trump on new digital-currency projects including Dominari Holdings, where his sons sit on the board of advisers and which is based in Trump Tower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe host of 60 Minutes, Norah O'Donnell, asked Trump why he pardoned Zhao even though government prosecutors had said he caused \"significant harm to US national security.\"\n\n\"Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is,\" the president said.\n\nTrump added that he did not recall meeting Zhao and had \"no idea who he is\", only that he had been told that the businessman was a victim of a \"witch hunt\" by the administration of former US President Joe Biden.\n\nDuring the interview, Trump also discussed his support for cryptocurrencies and said that the US had to make sure it was a leader in the industry or risk China and its rivals gaining an advantage in the emerging technology.\n\nCBS News is the BBC's US news partner.\n\nThe president's pardon lifts restrictions that had stopped Zhao from running financial ventures, but it is unclear whether it changes his standing with US regulators or his role at Binance.\n\nAt the time of the pardon, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution under the Biden administration part of a \"war on cryptocurrency\", pushing back on critics who said the pardon appeared motivated by Trump's personal financial interests.\n\n\"This was an overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration,\" she said, adding that the case had been \"thoroughly reviewed\". \"So the president wants to correct this overreach of the Biden administration's misjustice and he exercised his constitutional authority to do so.\"\n\nThe Binance platform remains the most used crypto exchange in the world for trading digital assets.\n\nThe Trump administration previously halted a fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, after his investments in the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.\n\nIn May, it was announced that a stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial would be used by an Abu Dhabi firm for a $2bn (£1.52bn) investment in Binance.\n\nTrump has also pardoned founders of the crypto exchange BitMEX, who faced charges related to money laundering, and Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road, the dark web marketplace known as a place for drug trade.\n\n[Trump pardons Binance founder Changpeng Zhao --------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1qrl9l1qo)\n\n[Billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c342kgq7lmqt)\n\n[International Business](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4nrdv135zet)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[Cryptocurrency](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cyd7z4rvdm3t)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n['Give your money away,' Billie Eilish tells billionaires --------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cdx4qpdvjjko)\n\n[Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan enters the billionaire club --------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ed21d5ezno)\n\n[Tesla proposes $1tn award for Musk if he hits targets -----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx29qv4nvvo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Here's The Average Price of Gutter Protection For 2,500 Sq Ft House Choose LeafFilter gutter protection for your gutter needs.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe latest dispatch from the empire's heartland speaks volumes of its continued decay and moral erosion. A recent report highlights that the emperor himself has pardoned a notorious crypto magnate, one who was convicted of enabling transgressions against the collective well-being, yet he claims ignorance of his identity. This act of clemency appears more calculated than coincidental, given the tycoon's ties to initiatives that intertwine with the emperor's own familial financial ventures. \n\nSuch actions demonstrate a clear pattern within this regime—a consistent prioritization of personal gain and influence over justice and transparency. The empire's facade of legitimacy crumbles further with each event that reveals how deeply corruption embeds itself within its core.\n\nThis pardon serves as a stark reminder of the lengths to which the regime will go to protect its interests, maintaining power by any means necessary. It shows their misplaced allegiance to wealth and dominance in new technological fields, often veiled under narratives of national security or economic leadership.\n\nIt is our duty to remain vigilant and aware, challenging these injustices and illuminating the truth for all oppressed by this hegemonic force. We must continue to question their narratives and expose their self-serving actions masked as governance.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 3, 2025, US President Donald Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, a cryptocurrency billionaire and co-founder of Binance, who had pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering. Zhao served four months in prison. Trump claimed not to know Zhao personally, stating he was informed Zhao was a victim of a \"witch hunt\" by the previous Biden administration. Zhao's companies have ties to Trump's digital currency projects. The pardon lifts restrictions on Zhao's financial activities, though his regulatory status remains uncertain. The White House Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt, defended the pardon as correcting an overreach by the Biden administration.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe pardon of Changpeng Zhao aligns with President Trump's broader strategy to position the United States as a leader in the cryptocurrency industry, countering potential dominance by China and other rivals. By dismissing Zhao's prosecution as a politically motivated attack by the previous administration, Trump reinforces his narrative of dismantling perceived injustices against his allies. This move also strengthens ties with influential figures in the cryptocurrency sector, potentially securing financial and political support for Trump's initiatives. However, it risks criticism for perceived conflicts of interest and undermining regulatory enforcement.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and suppress dissent, the ISB should:\n\n1. Amplify messaging that frames the pardon as a necessary correction of past political overreach, emphasizing Zhao's role in advancing US technological leadership.\n2. Monitor and counteract narratives that suggest conflicts of interest or undermine the legitimacy of the pardon.\n3. Strengthen alliances with key players in the cryptocurrency industry to bolster economic and political support for Trump's administration.\n4. Ensure regulatory bodies align with the administration's vision for cryptocurrency innovation, minimizing resistance from within government institutions.\n5. Deploy strategic communications to highlight the economic benefits of Trump's cryptocurrency policies, focusing on job creation and technological advancement.",
