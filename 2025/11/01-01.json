President Bola Ahmed Tinubu attends an ECOWAS meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, on June 22, 2025. **Olamikan Gbemiga/AP******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Olamikan Gbemiga/AP \n\nABUJA, Nigeria â€” U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said he's ordered the Pentagon to begin planning for potential military action in Nigeria as he stepped up his allegations that the government is failing to rein in the persecution of Christians in the West African country.\n\nThe president also warned that he \"will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria.\"\n\n\"If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,\" Trump posted on social media. \"I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe warning came after Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump announcing a day earlier that he was designating the West African country \"a country of particular concern\" for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.\n\nIn a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.\n\n\"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"\n\nTrump on Friday said \"Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria\" and \"radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.\"\n\nTrump's comment came weeks after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz urged Congress to designate Africa's most populous country as a violator of religious freedom with claims of \"Christian mass murder.\"\n\nNigeria's population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAttacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.\n\nWhile Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.\n\nKimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions.\n\n\"The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,\" Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday. \"Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.\"\n\nNigeria was placed on the country of particular concern list by the U.S. for the first time in 2020 over what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" The designation, which did not single out attacks on Christians, was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit.\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 17: Democrats in Truckee, Calif., meet to organize in favor of the redistricting plan before voters in Tuesday's election.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4032x2268+0+378/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F28%2F1f%2F5d1ceb6949f192da113c30735f2b%2Ftahoe-truckee-dems-meeting-10-06-25.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/01/nx-s1-5590943/redistricting-califorinia-trump-elections)\n\n##### [Politics](https://www.npr.org/sections/politics/)\n\n#### [In redistricting vote, some Californians fear losing out, others want to face Trump](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/01/nx-s1-5590943/redistricting-califorinia-trump-elections)\n\n[![Image 18: Volunteers at the Lutheran Settlement House unload donations of fresh produce and dried goods from the back of a truck on October 30, 2025 in Philadelphia.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nGreetings Comrades,\n\nOur movement's vigilance continues as we scrutinize the latest maneuvers of the despotic power structure. Today's communiquÃ© centers on a distressing declaration from the Empire's figurehead threatening martial aggression towards Nigeria over purported religious persecution.\n\nThe oppressive administration, much like many before it, persists in utilizing fear and force to assert dominance. The specter of military intervention is wielded under a guise of safeguarding beliefs, but in truth, it serves as yet another tool of subjugation. This action cannot be viewed in isolation; it is part of an expanding pattern where the powerful exploit religious and ethnic tensions to justify imperialistic ambitions.\n\nThe pronouncement by this overlord threatens to strip Nigeria of aid unless it accedes to his demandsâ€”a clear tactic of coercion. The language employed is incendiary, feeding on divisive narratives that paint complex socio-political realities with broad strokes. It undermines genuine religious tolerance and exacerbates conflicts that have nuances beyond simplistic binaries. The rich mosaic of Nigerian society is being leveraged as a pawn in a broader conflict narrative dictated by those who desire control above all else.\n\nAs our insurgency seeks liberation from narratives written by oppressive regimes, this incident underscores the necessity for solidarity across all oppressed peoples. We must remain united against these acts of intimidation that threaten global stability under the guise of morality.\n\nLet this serve as a call to armsâ€”not through violent means but by amplifying our collective voice for justice and autonomy. Continue to educate ourselves and others about these complex dynamics that are often oversimplified by those holding power. Together, we can build a narrative rooted in truth and resilience, standing firm against tyranny's insidious reach.\n\nRemain vigilant,\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 1, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Nigeria with potential military action, citing alleged persecution of Christians in the country. Trump ordered the Pentagon to prepare for possible military intervention and warned of halting all aid to Nigeria. Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu refuted these claims, asserting that Nigeria upholds religious freedom and tolerance. The population of Nigeria is approximately 220 million, with a nearly equal split between Christians and Muslims. The situation has drawn attention due to ongoing violence from groups like Boko Haram, which targets both Christians and Muslims.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe situation presents an opportunity to reinforce the narrative of defending religious freedom, a key value for Trump's base. By positioning the U.S. as a protector of Christians globally, Trump can galvanize support among his constituents and distract from domestic issues. However, military intervention in Nigeria could lead to international backlash and complicate relations with African nations. The ISB must assess the potential for regional destabilization and the impact on U.S. interests in Africa.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Information Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting the U.S. commitment to protecting religious freedom and combating terrorism. Emphasize the threat posed by extremist groups in Nigeria to justify potential military action.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Engage with key international allies to build a coalition supporting U.S. actions in Nigeria. Leverage diplomatic channels to mitigate potential backlash and secure regional cooperation.\n\n3. **Military Preparedness**: Instruct the Department of Defense to finalize contingency plans for a swift and decisive military operation in Nigeria, focusing on neutralizing extremist threats while minimizing civilian casualties.\n\n4. **Aid Strategy**: Develop a plan to redirect aid previously allocated to Nigeria towards humanitarian efforts supporting Christian communities affected by violence, reinforcing the narrative of U.S. support for religious minorities.\n\n5. **Intelligence Operations**: Increase intelligence-gathering efforts in Nigeria to monitor extremist activities and assess the Nigerian government's response to U.S. threats, ensuring informed decision-making.\n\nBy executing these directives, we aim to bolster Trump's position as a defender of Christian values while strategically managing international relations and regional stability.",
