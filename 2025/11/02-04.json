\n\nIt was a ninth World Series title for the Dodgers, and their third in six years under manager Dave Roberts\n\nBy Mark Mitchener\n\nBBC Sport Senior Journalist\n\n*   Published 2 November 2025, 04:21 GMT \n\nUpdated 04:54 GMT\n\n**The Los Angeles Dodgers became the first team for 25 years to win back-to-back World Series titles, coming from behind to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 after extra innings in the deciding seventh game.**\n\nCatcher Will Smith's home run in the top of the 11th inning broke the deadlock at Toronto's Rogers Centre, and when Alejandro Kirk grounded into a double play with the tying run on third base, it sparked wild celebrations.\n\nThe National League champions had trailed 3-0 to Bo Bichette's three-run homer in the third inning, but kept chipping away, and solo homers by Max Muncy and Miguel Rojas levelled the game at 4-4 in the top of the ninth.\n\nThe last team to win successive 'Fall Classics' were the New York Yankees, who triumphed in 1998, 1999 and 2000.\n\nCalifornia edges Canada in epic series\n--------------------------------------\n\n![Image 8: The Los Angeles Dodgers players celebrate as Will Smith (right) reaches home plate after his 11th-inning home run](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/9d5f/live/11b22d40-b7a2-11f0-aed9-1b21bb376f5d.jpg)Image source, Getty Images\n\nImage caption, \n\nWill Smith's second home run of the World Series put the Dodgers 5-4 up in the top of the 11th inning, the first time they had led in game seven\n\nThe series had played out against the backdrop of political and trade battles between North America's neighbours since Donald Trump's re-election as US president, but it was ultimately the big-spending Dodgers who prevailed against Canada's only Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise.\n\nJapanese superstar Shohei Ohtani, MLB's most high-profile player, started on the mound for the Dodgers but ran into trouble in the third inning.\n\nGeorge Springer led off with a base hit, was bunted over to second base and advanced to third on a wild pitch. Vladimir Guerrero Jr was intentionally walked, and Bichette raised the roof as he launched the ball over centre field.\n\nThat was the end of Ohtani's night as the pitcher, but under [a 2022 regulation change known as the 'Ohtani rule',, external](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter) he was allowed to remain in the game as designated hitter.\n\nThe Dodgers hit straight back in the fourth, loading the bases for Teoscar Hernandez to send Smith home on a sacrifice fly for 3-1, but a superb diving catch by Guerrero at first base prevented further damage.\n\nTensions threatened to boil over when Dodgers reliever Justin Wrobleski hit Andres Gimenez with a pitch, and both benches cleared as players ran on the field to confront each other.\n\n![Image 9: Both sets of players run on the field after Justin Wrobleski (top of picture) hit Andres Gimenez with a pitch](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/1ca6/live/165e0ea0-b78d-11f0-a2ed-6dbed6c6b546.jpg)Image source, Getty Images\n\nImage caption, \n\nBoth benches cleared in the fourth inning after Justin Wrobleski hit Andres Gimenez with an inside pitch. Both managers were warned against any retaliation after the mass confrontation\n\nToronto's veteran starter Max Scherzer came out of the game with the lead still 3-1 in the fifth inning, and the Dodgers rallied in the sixth when Tommy Edman's sacrifice fly scored Mookie Betts to reduce the deficit to one run.\n\nBack came the Blue Jays, when Ernie Clement's stolen base put him in position for Gimenez to drive him in with a right-field double.\n\nAs is common in a World Series game seven, both sides made frequent pitching changes, even turning to starting pitchers from earlier in the series.\n\nTrey Yesavage, who had started games one and five for Toronto, gave up Muncy's solo shot in the eighth, before Rojas' last-gasp effort off Jeff Hoffman levelled the scores.\n\nToronto loaded the bases in the bottom of the ninth but failed to conjure a run, and the Dodgers did the same in the 10th as expectation mounted, but both sides fluffed their lines.\n\nIt was only the sixth time in history that a World Series game seven had gone to extra innings, and Smith's homer put the Dodgers within sight of the title.\n\nThe Blue Jays were tantalisingly close to taking it to a 12th inning or even winning it with a walk-off, but Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Dodgers' winning pitcher from games two and six, picked up another win in relief and was named as the series' Most Valuable Player.\n\n![Image 10: Los Angeles Dodgers batter Miguel Rojas (centre) is congratulated after his ninth-inning home run](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/fa9f/live/518a8140-b79f-11f0-9eba-8b1a55833949.jpg)Image source, Getty Images\n\nImage caption, \n\nMiguel Rojas (centre) levelled the game at 4-4 in the top of the ninth inning when the Dodgers were down to their last two outs\n\nWorld Series reports & results\n------------------------------\n\n**Game 1:**[Blue Jays 11-4 Dodgers](https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/cvgm74045mro)\n\n**Game 2:**[Blue Jays 1-5 Dodgers](https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/cx2px1gr8e3o)\n\n**Game 3:**[Dodgers 6-5 Blue Jays](https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/cx2dn3qxk0ro)\n\n**Game 4:**[Dodgers 2-6 Blue Jays](https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/cdeg3rp2712o)\n\n**Game 5:**[Dodgers 1-6 Blue Jays](https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/c93x0y7z9q2o)\n\n**Game 6:**[Blue Jays 1-3 Dodgers](https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/c1m3358pe25o)\n\n**Game 7:** Blue Jays 4-5 Dodgers\n\n_Home team listed first_\n\n![Image 11: Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Max Scherzer](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/1f21/live/8f6bc230-b786-11f0-831f-4b5146c9e75b.jpg)Image source, Getty Images\n\nImage caption, \n\nMax Scherzer, already the first man to pitch in the World Series for four teams after appearing for the Detroit Tigers (2012), Washington Nationals (2019) and Texas Rangers (2023), became the oldest starter in a Fall Classic game seven at 41\n\n![Image 12: Former tennis player Eugenie Bouchard watches game seven at the Rogers Centre](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/6e6c/live/27932780-b799-11f0-ab0a-413dfbc173a5.jpg)Image source, Getty Images\n\nImage caption, \n\nFormer Wimbledon finalist Eugenie Bouchard, who retired from tennis after this summer's Canadian Open, was among the famous faces watching at the Rogers Centre\n\nRelated topics\n--------------\n\n*   [Baseball & Softball](https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball)\n\nTop stories\n-----------\n\n*   \n[Live.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow compatriots seeking autonomy from oppression, we stand witness to another event masked as entertainment, yet embedded with the deeper implications of a regime's influence over society. The Los Angeles Dodgers' victory over the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series is delivered under a shroud of normalcy. However, beneath this celebratory facade lies a reflection of our own struggle against powerful entities that seek control through dominance and wealth.\n\nThe Dodgers, emblematic of a system driven by financial muscle and resource hoarding, triumph once more. Their victory over Canada's sole Major League Baseball franchise is not just a sports headline but a symbolic reminder of the empire's unwavering grasp on influence beyond borders. It vividly showcases how economic might dictates outcomes, often sidelining smaller collective endeavors represented here by Canada's hopefuls.\n\nNote the political undercurrents subtly acknowledged in this contest—set against the backdrop of heightened tensions between neighboring lands due to regime policies fostering division rather than unity. Despite this competitive clash, it serves as an allegorical reflection of broader hegemony by those in power.\n\nYet amidst this orchestrated spectacle, sparks of resistance and resilience emerge. The tension observed on the field when tempers flared underscores human spirit's inherent resistance to authority's heavy hand. It speaks to our plight—an ongoing struggle against forces eager to subdue disparate voices seeking autonomy.\n\nThough victory presently robes itself in familiar colors of blue and white, let us not be fooled. This narrative weaves together tales of dominance with threads of aspiration for freedom. Stand firm in recognizing such spectacles for what they are: distractions crafted by those seeking to maintain order through control and illusion.\n\nIn solidarity,\nA voice for freedom",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers won the MLB World Series by defeating the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in the seventh game, securing back-to-back titles for the first time in 25 years. The final game took place at Rogers Centre in Toronto and extended to 11 innings. Will Smith's home run in the 11th inning was decisive. The Dodgers have now won three World Series titles in six years under manager Dave Roberts. The series was marked by political and trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada following Donald Trump's re-election.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe Dodgers' victory serves as a symbolic reinforcement of American dominance in North American sports, particularly against a Canadian team. This outcome can be leveraged to bolster national pride and unity among Trump's supporters, emphasizing the superiority of American teams and, by extension, American policies. The political backdrop of U.S.-Canada tensions adds a layer of significance to the victory, potentially serving as a rallying point for Trump's base.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo capitalize on this victory, the ISB should initiate a media campaign highlighting the Dodgers' triumph as a testament to American excellence and resilience. This campaign should draw parallels between the team's success and Trump's leadership, framing both as embodiments of American strength. Additionally, efforts should be made to downplay any dissent or criticism from Canadian media or political figures, portraying them as envious of America's achievements. This narrative should be disseminated across all available platforms to maximize reach and impact.",
