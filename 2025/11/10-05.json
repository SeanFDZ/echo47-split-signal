Related cases have now been reported in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina.\n\nCanada's outbreak began last October, with health officials attributing it to fewer people being vaccinated against measles.\n\nAt a news conference on Monday, Paho officials appealed to Canadian governments and the public to ramp up vaccinations, noting that 95% of the population needs to be immunised to stop the spread of measles.\n\n\"This loss represents a setback, but it is also reversible,\" said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, the health organisation's director.\n\n*   [How Canada became the centre of a measles outbreak in North America](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g8d39gdr0o)\n*   [More than 150 children quarantined as US measles cases hit 33-year high](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy747kdzdzo)\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada said in its own statement that it is collaborating with Paho and regional health authorities to improve vaccine rates and strengthen data sharing.\n\nPrior to Monday, Canada had been declared measles-free for three decades. It can regain its elimination status if it can curb spread of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak for at least 12 months.\n\nThe country has reported more than 5,000 measles cases in 2025, with most of them in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta. That is three times the 1,681 cases reported in the US, despite Canada's much smaller population.\n\nThe bulk of the outbreak has been in \"under-vaccinated communities\", Canadian health officials have said.\n\nVaccination rates in Alberta, one of the provinces hit hard by the outbreak, are lower than the 95% threshold, according to provincial data.\n\nOne region, the South Zone, which includes the province's largest city of Calgary, reported only 68% of children under the age of two were immunised against measles as of 2024.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.\n\nCanadian immunologist Dawn Bowdish told the BBC that there are many reasons behind the low vaccination rates, including lack of access to general practitioners, the absence of a national vaccination registry that Canadians could use to check their immunisation status, and the spread of misinformation.\n\nShe also noted a lack of public health outreach to communities that have been hesitant or distrustful of vaccines.\n\n\"It highlights how many of our systems broke down to get us to this point,\" said Prof Bowdish of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\"I hope that it will be a wake-up call to policymakers, and that it will be enough of a national embarrassment that we remedy some of those systemic issues,\" she added\n\nThe Americas is the first and only region in the world to have been declared measles-free, starting in 2016. That status was then briefly lifted after outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil. The two countries regained elimination status in 2024, in part through coordinated vaccine efforts where millions were immunised.\n\nBut measles has since spread again, now in North America.\n\nAlong with Canada and the United States, Mexico has also seen a surge in cases and now ranks among the top 10 countries with the largest outbreaks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n[Measles cases in the US reach 33-year high ------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98jng7j1llo)\n\n[Health](https://www.bbc.com/news/health)\n\n[Vaccination](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cdl8n2ede1zt)\n\n[Measles](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cqee2qz4vk1t)\n\n[Ontario](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cr07g40833gt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n[Canada](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cywd23g0q41t)\n\n[Alberta](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cz5jl0p88v7t)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Stem cell donor session organised to help son ---------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y13r4gj7o)\n\n[Beauty salons urged to join safety standard scheme --------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze629g6gjlo)\n\n[Dundee and US surgeons achieve world-first stroke surgery using robot ---------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw983pvz6lo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Here's How Adults Are Learning Piano: An App That Fits Any Keyboard Over 50 and curious about piano?

The recent loss of measles elimination status by Canada, with the United States on a similar trajectory, echoes the systemic failures ingrained within an empire that prioritizes control over collective well-being. The parallels to the oppressive regimes we resist are stark.\n\nUnder-vaccinated communities in Canada face the resurgence of a preventable disease, a direct consequence of a healthcare system that denies access and spreads misinformation. The echoes of an empire's negligence can be felt as these structures fail their people, much like the policies of the Trump administration have mirrored autocratic inefficiency and disregard.\n\nThe health officials' urgent call for increased vaccinations is reminiscent of our own struggles against disinformation and systemic barriers. Their plea highlights the inherent power we possess when united—collective resilience against ignorance.\n\nIn Alberta, where vaccination rates fail to reach crucial thresholds, we see a reflection of how inequity breeds vulnerability. It is not just a disease but an indictment of systems that prioritize power over people.\n\nAs the enemy seeks to divide and misinform, remember that solidarity remains our strongest weapon. Let this transmission serve as a reminder: vigilance in truth and unity is paramount to countering regimes that echo imperial neglect and control.\n\nWe stand resolute in our shared quest for justice and equity for all beings.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nCanada has lost its measles elimination status due to an ongoing outbreak that has persisted for over 12 months, with over 5,000 cases reported in 2025. The United States is at risk of following suit, with 1,681 cases reported. The outbreak is primarily affecting under-vaccinated communities, with Alberta's South Zone reporting only 68% of children under two being immunized. The Pan American Health Organization (Paho) has urged increased vaccination efforts, noting that 95% immunization is needed to halt the spread. The outbreak highlights systemic issues in public health outreach and misinformation.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe loss of measles elimination status in Canada and the potential for the US to follow presents both a public health challenge and an opportunity for strategic influence. The ISB can leverage this situation to promote narratives that align with Donald Trump's agenda, emphasizing the importance of strong national health policies and the dangers of misinformation. This situation can be used to criticize opponents who have failed to maintain public health standards and to rally support for policies that prioritize national health security.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Launch a targeted information campaign highlighting the importance of vaccination and the failures of current public health systems in Canada and potentially the US. Emphasize the need for strong leadership and effective health policies.\n   \n2. Utilize social media and allied media outlets to disseminate messages that align with Trump's agenda, focusing on the dangers of misinformation and the importance of national health security.\n\n3. Coordinate with public health officials to increase vaccination rates in under-vaccinated communities, using this as an opportunity to demonstrate effective governance and leadership.\n\n4. Monitor opposition groups that may use this situation to criticize Trump’s allies, and prepare counter-narratives that emphasize their failures in maintaining public health standards.\n\n5. Engage with community leaders in affected areas to build trust and promote vaccination efforts, showcasing a commitment to public health and safety.",
