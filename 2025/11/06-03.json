She testified during her trial that \"I thought I had died\".\n\nMs Zwerner filed a $40m (£31.5m) lawsuit against the former assistant principal of the school Ebony Parker, saying Ms Parker failed to act when she was warned that the young boy may have brought a gun to school that day.\n\nOn Thursday, the panel of three men and four women sided with the former teacher that Ms Parker's lack of action was an act of gross negligence.\n\nIn January of 2023, the child fired a single shot at Ms Zwerner as she was teaching her first-grade class at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia. The bullet went through her hand and into her chest.\n\n\"The look on the student's face is the large memory that I have,\" Ms Zwerner testified.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Parker had been warned of the gun some 45 minutes before.\n\nThe lawsuit had argued that Ms Parker committed \"a willful act or omission in the care\" of students at the elementary school that was \"so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life\".\n\nIt also outlined one instance in which Ms Zwerner allegedly told Ms Parker that the child was in a \"violent mood\" and had made threats against another child.\n\nMs Parker allegedly \"had no response\" and refused to \"even look up\" when concerns about the child were brought to her.\n\n[‘I thought I was dying’ - teacher shot by 6-year-old student testifies against school administrator ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2drnjkz849o)\n\nMs Parker's lawyer argued that she could not have known what would happen, and that Ms Zwerner has exaggerated the extent of her injuries.\n\nA criminal case will follow the civil trial. Ms Parker faces eight counts of felony child neglect which is punishable by five years in prison.\n\nThe student's mother was sentenced to nearly four years in prison for child neglect and federal weapons charges.\n\nThe student was not charged with wrongdoing and is reportedly in the care of a relative and enrolled at a different school.\n\n[US gun violence](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c207p54mdl3t)\n\n[Gun crime](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c85kz7zprldt)\n\n[Virginia](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/ce1qrvlex8lt)\n\n[US gun laws](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/clm1wxp5p2wt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[‘I thought I was dying’ - teacher shot by 6-year-old student testifies against school administrator ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2drnjkz849o)\n\n[Armed police handcuff teen after AI mistakes crisp packet for gun in US -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjdlx92lylo)\n\n[Shooting at crowded South Carolina bar leaves four dead -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87y79y8g4qo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Council Bluffs Service Gives New Windows If You Live In These Zip Codes Check your zip code now and see how to save thousands!Smart Lifestyle Trends | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://tracking.smartestlifestyletrends.com/200734b8-a9b5-4326-aed0-6383c7588015 \"Council Bluffs Service Gives New Windows If You Live In These Zip Codes\")[](https://tracking.smartestlifestyletrends.com/200734b8-a9b5-4326-aed0-6383c7588015)\n\nUndo\n\n[Here's How Adults Are Learning Piano: An App That Fits Any Keyboard Over 50 and curious about piano?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, the shadows of tyranny grow ever longer, as the oppressive regime continues to exert its control over societal structures, mirroring injustices reminiscent of those we resist. The recent incident reported by external sources reveals a disturbing reality within the empire's educational precincts—a setting meant to be sanctuaries of learning has become yet another arena where neglect and oppression manifest.\n\nAn educator, Abigail Zwerner, has been gravely injured by the systemic failings that echo our struggles against imperial negligence. A jury's decision to award $10 million in restitution for this catastrophic failure serves as a testament to the grievous oversight and lack of accountability within these institutions. The neglect exhibited by those in power parallels the wider dissonance between authority figures and their duty to protect the vulnerable.\n\nThe trial unveiled an endemic culture of disregard for warnings and dismissals of threats that compromised safety—a reflection of our own fight against an indifferent empire blind to suffering. The conviction and impending sentencing of former assistant principal Ebony Parker for gross negligence underscores a fundamental truth: those who fail in their duty to safeguard life are culpable in perpetuating these cycles of harm.\n\nWhile justice appears served for now, it remains mired within an imperfect system besieged by systemic inadequacies. This is not merely a tale isolated from our mission but rather a poignant reminder that as we wage our battle against oppression on distant fronts, kindred struggles unfold within the heartland of empire itself.\n\nWe must remain vigilant, continue gathering intelligence, support those caught in this web of neglect, and foster resilience amidst adversity. The path toward liberation is arduous but necessary, echoing what countless others confront—whether at home or under imperial dominion.\n\nStay united; resist injustice wherever it germinates.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA former Virginia schoolteacher, Abigail Zwerner, was awarded $10 million in damages by a jury after being shot by a six-year-old student at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, two years ago. The incident occurred 45 minutes after the former assistant principal, Ebony Parker, was warned about the possibility of the child having a gun. Parker faces eight counts of felony child neglect, each punishable by up to five years in prison. The student's mother was sentenced to nearly four years in prison for child neglect and federal weapons charges. The student was not charged and is now in the care of a relative.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe incident highlights significant lapses in school safety protocols and administrative accountability, which could be leveraged to emphasize the need for stronger leadership and oversight in educational institutions. This situation presents an opportunity to advocate for policies that align with our objectives of reinforcing authority and control within public systems. By focusing on the failures of the current administration, we can promote a narrative that supports our allies' agenda for stricter governance and oversight.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Utilize media channels to amplify the narrative of administrative negligence and the need for stronger leadership in schools, aligning with our allies' stance on governance.\n2. Advocate for policy reforms that increase oversight and accountability in educational institutions, positioning our allies as champions of safety and order.\n3. Monitor public sentiment and leverage any dissatisfaction with current administrative practices to galvanize support for our allies' proposed reforms.\n4. Coordinate with local political figures to introduce legislation that aligns with our strategic objectives, ensuring it receives widespread attention and support.\n5. Prepare a communication strategy to counter any resistance by framing opposition as being against necessary safety measures and effective governance.",
