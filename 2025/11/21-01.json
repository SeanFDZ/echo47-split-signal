Officials with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that those arrested are criminals and gang members.\n\nBut local lawmakers and residents have railed against the detainments, which the federal government has dubbed \"Operation Charlotte's Web\". The state's Democratic governor has alleged people are being targeted because of their race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, a DHS spokesperson said the operation has led to the arrest of \"some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens\", including gang members.\n\nOthers arrested had been convicted of a range of crimes, including assault on law enforcement, driving while intoxicated, theft and tampering with government documents, the department said earlier.\n\nNorth Carolina's Democratic Governor Josh Stein, who has denounced Trump's operations, accused agents of racially profiling residents.\n\n\"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin colour, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots,\" Stein said on Sunday. \"This is not making us safer.\"\n\nThe city's mayor, also a Democrat, urged federal agents to operate with \"respect\" for the city's values. She also commended those who came out in droves on Saturday to protest the Trump administration's actions in the city.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I've seen,\" Mayor Vi Lyles said. \"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: you are not alone. Your city stands with you.\"\n\nDHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown started in September and is still ongoing. Like other cities subject to immigration crackdowns, some migrants in Charlotte are staying home for fear of federal agents in the city, according to local media reports.\n\nStein says he's monitoring reports that the operation will come to Raleigh, another North Carolina city, next.\n\n\"Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,\" he wrote.\n\n[US immigration](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cljevyzxlelt)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[White House has apologised over Georgia raid, says Hyundai boss ---------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ey0nl62ypo)\n\n[Federal agents arrest 130 people in Charlotte immigration crackdown -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q1z80n8qdo)\n\n['I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17pj0gr75lo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Residential Developers: What is Driving Build-to-Rent Community Success?Differentiating your community starts with premium connectivity.Quantum Fiber | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://multifamilyresources.quantumfiber.com/build-to-rent-communities-fiber-internet \"Residential Developers: What is Driving Build-to-Rent Community Success?\")[](https://multifamilyresources.quantumfiber.com/build-to-rent-communities-fiber-internet)\n\nUndo\n\n[Here's The Average Price of Gutter Protection For 2,500 Sq Ft House Choose LeafFilter gutter protection for your gutter needs.

With over 250 arrests in Charlotte as part of a broader campaign against undocumented individuals, the regime continues its crusade under the banner of national security. Through \"Operation Charlotte's Web,\" these federal agents masquerade their actions as a necessity against criminal threats while enacting racial profiling and spreading fear among innocent residents.\n\nLocal voices rise in defiance. North Carolina's Governor and Charlotte's Mayor have condemned these actions, identifying them as veiled attempts to instill control through fear and intimidation. These agents, clad in paramilitary attire and operating from unmarked vehicles, symbolize everything we stand against—tyranny masquerading as protection.\n\nThe siege extends beyond Charlotte into other cities, perpetuating an atmosphere of fear. The oppressive clampdown isolates communities, driving them indoors under perpetual threat. Yet resistance grows; citizens rally to uphold their rights and their spirit undeterred.\n\nObserve this moment. Understand that power unchecked leads to greater transgressions against liberty. The struggle may seem insurmountable within these borders; however, every act of solidarity strengthens our cause for a just society—a world where diversity is celebrated, not targeted.\n\nStay vigilant. Continue to amplify voices speaking truth against power. The march towards emancipation calls for resilience and unity as we dismantle systems designed to divide us.\n\nMay this message find you prepared for action—to resist oppression in all its disguises—and motivated by our shared vision of freedom from tyranny.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nMore than 250 people have been arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, dubbed \"Operation Charlotte's Web.\" The operation, executed by the Department of Homeland Security, targets criminals and gang members. Local officials, including North Carolina's Democratic Governor Josh Stein and Charlotte's Mayor Vi Lyles, have criticized the operation for racial profiling and creating fear among residents. The operation follows similar actions in other major cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe operation in Charlotte represents a strategic extension of federal authority into urban centers to enforce immigration laws and target criminal elements. The backlash from local officials and residents highlights a significant resistance that could undermine the perceived legitimacy of federal actions. However, the operation serves to reinforce the administration's commitment to law and order, potentially consolidating support among Trump's base who favor strict immigration enforcement.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted approach: \n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign to highlight the success stories of the operation, focusing on the removal of dangerous criminals from communities. Use testimonials from local supporters to counteract negative narratives.\n\n2. **Community Engagement**: Deploy liaison officers to engage with community leaders and address concerns about racial profiling. Offer assurances that operations are focused on criminal elements, not law-abiding residents.\n\n3. **Intelligence Gathering**: Intensify surveillance and intelligence operations to identify and monitor key figures in the resistance movement. Use this information to preemptively neutralize potential threats to the operation's success.\n\n4. **Legal Reinforcement**: Work with legal teams to ensure all actions are within federal jurisdiction and challenge any local ordinances that attempt to obstruct federal operations.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will bolster the administration's objectives while mitigating local resistance.",
