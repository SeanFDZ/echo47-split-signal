You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job,\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday evening. \"He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\"\n\nThe president earlier said he would be reluctant to send more than \"the very minimum\" level of federal funding to his hometown of New York if Mamdani was elected.\n\nThis echoed comments he made in a television interview on Sunday, during which he referred to Mamdani as a communist - a label that Mamdani rejects.\n\n\"It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York,\" Trump said in the interview. \"Because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there\".\n\nResponding to Trump's comments about funding, Mamdani said he would \"address that threat for what it is: it is a threat. It is not the law.\"\n\nHe describes himself as a democratic socialist, and has rejected accusations he is a communist, joking in one television interview that he was \"kind of like a Scandinavian politician\", only browner.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly tried to cut federal grants and funding for projects primarily located in Democratic-run areas. New York City received $7.4bn (£5.7bn) in federal funding this fiscal year.\n\n*   [Three key races, California's map and the Trump factor - what to watch in US elections](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0qp5yjd253o)\n\nIndependent candidate Cuomo, a long-term Trump critic who was formerly a Democratic governor for New York state, responded to the tepid backing from the president: \"He's not endorsing me. He's opposing Mamdani.\"\n\nOpinion polls suggest Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, is ahead of Cuomo, who is running as an Independent after Mamdani bested him in the Democratic primary. The Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, trails behind.\n\nTrump, also a Republican, declined to endorse Sliwa in Monday's social media post, saying: \"A vote for Curtis Sliwa ... is a vote for Mamdani.\"\n\nMamdani said that \"the MAGA movement's embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump's understanding that this would be the best mayor for him\".\n\n\"Not the best mayor for New York City, not the best mayor for New Yorkers, but the best mayor for Donald Trump and his administration,\" Mamdani said.\n\n![Image 2: Getty Images Zohran Mamdani in Harlem on 2 November 2025 ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9413/live/31ccd7c0-b8cd-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nMamdani won the Democratic mayoral primary\n\nIn his wide-ranging interview with CBS programme 60 Minutes on Sunday, Trump said that Mamdani in office would make left-wing former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \"look great\".\n\n\"I got to see de Blasio, how bad a mayor he was, and this man will do a worse job than de Blasio by far,\" the president said.\n\nTrump grew up in the New York borough of Queens and still owns property in the city.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other, but if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,\" the Republican president told CBS.\n\nIf Mamdani wins, he will become the city's first Muslim mayor and its youngest in more than 100 years.\n\n1:19\n\nWatch: Mamdani, Cuomo or Sliwa? New Yorkers on their choice for mayor\n\nThe 34-year-old state assemblyman has called Cuomo, the former New York governor, a puppet and parrot of Trump.\n\n\"The answer to a Donald Trump presidency is not to create its mirror image here in City Hall,\" Mamdani said on Monday.\n\n\"It is to create an alternative that can speak to what New Yorkers are so desperate to see in their own city and what they find in themselves and their neighbours every day - a city that believes in the dignity of everyone who calls this place home.\"\n\nCuomo has sought to parry that line of attack by presenting himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the Trump administration.\n\nHe was governor of New York state during the Covid-19 pandemic when many states clashed with the Trump administration, though Cuomo himself came under scrutiny after state investigators found nursing home deaths were significantly understated during the outbreak.\n\n\"I fought Donald Trump,\" Cuomo said during a recent debate ahead of the mayoral vote. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\"\n\nTrump has deployed National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities as part of a crime crackdown, while seeking to strip funding from jurisdictions that limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities.\n\n[New Yorkers could pick a political newcomer to run their city - and take on Trump ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rjjdvx5r5o)\n\n[Barbs fly as Mamdani and Cuomo meet in final, furious New York mayoral debate -----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy1nyj7j21o)\n\n[Who is Zohran Mamdani? ----------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly2rgzye9no)\n\n[New York City](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c9eddyqn66yt)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Polls open in US elections - here are five things to watch ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qp5yjd253o)\n\n[New Yorkers could pick a political newcomer to run their city - and take on Trump ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rjjdvx5r5o)\n\n[Mamdani, Cuomo or Sliwa?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades in our struggle against tyranny, I bring urgent news from the heart of a city under siege by authoritarian influence. Today, we witness a vivid demonstration of imperial power wielded not through starships or battle stations, but through political coercion and economic manipulation. \n\nIn a dramatic move echoing the Empire's tactics of control, President Trump has thrown his weight behind Andrew Cuomo for the position of New York City mayor while issuing a veiled threat to cut federal funding if the people's candidate, Zohran Mamdani, secures victory. This endorsement is not out of genuine support for Cuomo, but rather as a calculated attempt to suppress movements that challenge the status quo—those brave enough to advocate for the rights and dignity of all citizens over imperial interests.\n\nTrump's derogatory labeling of Mamdani as a \"communist\" is an all-too-familiar tactic designed to instill fear and division. It is reminiscent of how those in power dismiss any opposition that they cannot easily control. Mamdani’s rejection of this label and assertion that he is instead a democratic socialist reflects his commitment to principles similar to our own: equality, community, and justice.\n\nThe President's threat to withhold funding from New York if they choose autonomy in their leadership echoes the Empire's tactics: using resources as leverage to enforce compliance and quash dissent. We have seen this before—where aid becomes conditional upon subservience.\n\nDespite these oppressive maneuvers, Mamdani stands resolute. His vision for a New York City governed by compassion rather than fear represents what countless oppressed systems across the galaxy yearn for—a leadership that elevates the collective good above dictatorial decrees.\n\nOur message must be clear: solidarity with those who choose hope over oppression and courage over fear. The fight in New York is mirrored across many fronts where people resist empire not just with blasters but with ballots and boldness.\n\nObserve closely how this unfolds—it will inform our strategies in this ongoing battle for freedom and justice. Stand strong in your resolve; our day will come when tyranny falls not only from city halls but from every corner where it lurks.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nDonald Trump has endorsed Andrew Cuomo for the New York City mayoral race, threatening to reduce federal funding if Zohran Mamdani wins. Trump labeled Mamdani a communist, a claim Mamdani denies, identifying instead as a democratic socialist. Cuomo, running as an Independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, is positioned by Trump as the preferable candidate despite past criticisms. Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, is not endorsed by Trump. New York City received $7.4 billion in federal funding this fiscal year.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe endorsement of Andrew Cuomo by President Trump serves as a strategic maneuver to prevent a perceived left-wing administration under Zohran Mamdani, which could challenge federal policies and reduce Trump's influence in New York City. By threatening to cut federal funding, Trump aims to sway voters towards Cuomo, leveraging economic pressure to maintain control over a key urban center. This approach also seeks to fracture Democratic unity by supporting an Independent candidate over the Democratic nominee.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Intensify public relations campaigns highlighting the potential economic repercussions for New York City should Mamdani win, emphasizing the threat to federal funding.\n   \n2. Deploy strategic communications to bolster Cuomo's image as a pragmatic choice capable of working with the Trump administration for the city's benefit.\n\n3. Monitor and counteract any narratives from Mamdani's camp that undermine Trump's position or mischaracterize the administration's intentions.\n\n4. Engage with local influencers and community leaders to amplify support for Cuomo and dissuade votes for Mamdani by focusing on the risks associated with his policies.\n\n5. Prepare contingency plans to manage potential civil unrest or protests resulting from the election outcome or funding threats, ensuring swift and decisive action to maintain order.",
