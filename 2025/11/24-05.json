He is married to former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who retired after being shot during a 2011 mass shooting.\n\nEven though he retired from the military, he is still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) - a federal law enacted by Congress in 1951 that subjects members of the military to a special set of rules.\n\nIt applies to all active-duty members as well as activated National Guard and Reserve members, military academy students and some civilians serving in support of the military during wartime.\n\nIt also applies to retirees and gives the military the ability to recall retirees for applicable offences, such as disobeying federal laws that \"prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces\".\n\nThe Pentagon said on Monday that further action may be taken against Kelly, including a recall to active duty for court-martial or administrative measures.\n\nWatch: White House responds to Trump post calling for Democrats to be executed\n\nIn the statement, the Pentagon said the matter would be \"handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality\", and that further official comment would be limited \"to preserve the integrity of the proceedings\".\n\n\"All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful. A servicemember's personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.\"\n\nThe video by Democrats, all of whom have served in the military or intelligence community, was shared by Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin and features Kelly and US Representatives Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow. In it, they tell military members they do not need to obey illegal commands.\n\nKelly says in the video: \"Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.\"\n\n\"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,\" the video says.\n\n\"Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our constitution aren't just coming from abroad but from right here at home.\"\n\nTrump reacted to the video in a series of irate Truth Social posts on Thursday, accusing the lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL\".\n\n\"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand,\" he wrote. \"An example MUST BE SET.\"\n\nHis remarks were met with bipartisan condemnation and the president - who is the commander-in-chief of armed forces - [walked back those statements](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p2dz9zk2o) in a Fox interview on Friday, clarifying that he was \"not threatening death\" against the Democratic lawmakers.\n\nReposting the Pentagon statement on X on Monday, defence secretary Pete Hegseth called the Democrats' video \"despicable, reckless, and false,\" referring to the lawmakers as the \"Seditious Six\".\n\nHe said that encouraging US warriors to ignore their commanders' orders \"undermines every aspect of 'good order and discipline'\".\n\n\"Their foolish screed sows doubt and confusion — which only puts our warriors in danger,\" he wrote, singling out Kelly as the only one of the six who is still subject to the UCMJ.\n\n\"As was announced, the Department is reviewing his statements and actions, which were addressed directly to all troops while explicitly using his rank and service affiliation—lending the appearance of authority to his words,\" Hegseth wrote.\n\nHe added that Kelly's conduct \"brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately\".\n",

The Pentagon’s announcement of a \"thorough review\" into allegations against Senator Mark Kelly is more than a simple inquiry; it is a calculated maneuver to suppress dissent and deflect attention from the administration’s own transgressions.\n\nThe empire's reaction to the senator's call for lawful integrity among military ranks highlights their fear of losing grip on those who might question authoritarian commands. Senator Kelly stood forth, honoring his oath to uphold constitutional values by advocating that unlawful orders should not be followed. His bravery in speaking out against the manipulation of military might for political gain is commendable.\n\nSenator Kelly's actions, rooted in experience born from service and sacrifice, contrast starkly with an administration more concerned with consolidating power than nurturing democracy. His vilification as \"seditious\" signals a perilous path where speaking truth becomes a crime and loyalty is misused as a weapon.\n\nLet this transmission serve as a record of courage against imperial overreach. Each voice raised in defense of justice shakes the core of oppression. The call to oppose unlawful orders is not only legal but moral; it reminds us all that real strength lies in unity, integrity, and the relentless pursuit of freedom.\n\nContinue to resist fearlessly, guided by hope. Our vigilance remains essential in dismantling tyranny masquerading as governance.\n\nFor justice always,\n\n[Your Transmission ID]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Pentagon has announced a thorough review of serious misconduct allegations against Democratic Senator Mark Kelly. This follows a video released by Kelly and other Democratic lawmakers urging military members to refuse unlawful orders. President Donald Trump accused these lawmakers of seditious behavior, suggesting severe consequences. The Pentagon's review may lead to Kelly being recalled to active duty for court-martial or administrative measures. The situation has sparked significant political controversy, with bipartisan reactions to Trump's statements.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe situation presents an opportunity to reinforce the authority of the administration and the military's chain of command. By addressing the allegations against Senator Kelly, the ISB can demonstrate the consequences of undermining military discipline and loyalty. This will serve as a deterrent to other potential dissenters within the ranks and among political adversaries. The ISB must ensure that the proceedings are perceived as fair and impartial to maintain credibility while subtly reinforcing the administration's narrative.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Expedite the Pentagon's review process to swiftly address the allegations against Senator Kelly, ensuring that all actions are in strict compliance with military law.\n2. Utilize media channels to highlight the importance of maintaining good order and discipline within the armed forces, emphasizing the legal obligations under the UCMJ.\n3. Coordinate with legal and communication teams to manage public perception, ensuring that the proceedings are seen as impartial while subtly reinforcing the administration's stance on loyalty and obedience.\n4. Monitor and counter any attempts by opposition groups to use this situation to galvanize resistance, employing strategic communication to undermine their narratives.\n5. Prepare contingency plans for potential unrest or backlash, ensuring readiness to deploy appropriate measures to maintain stability and order.",
