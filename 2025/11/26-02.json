The extra revenue would raise funds for conservation and maintenance at the sites, the White House said at the time - even as [the Trump administration planned deep cuts](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx7kez4vx2o) to the Park Service budget.\n\nUS national parks have seen [record numbers of tourists](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/socialscience/visitor-use-statistics-dashboard.htm) in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before.\n\nThe country's most visited parks include the Everglades in Florida, Yosemite in California and Colorado's Rocky Mountains.\n\n[Tourist tax expected to be introduced for London ------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87472445g4o)\n\n[Cuts to national parks and forests met with backlash ----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx7kez4vx2o)\n\n[Tourism](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c0eledl9rlmt)\n\n[Grand Canyon](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4e718x4ze1t)\n\n[International Business](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4nrdv135zet)\n\n[Holidays](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c5rzdre1k8qt)\n\n[Travel](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c5vz82vqnr1t)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Yorkshire mayors welcome tourist tax powers -------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjg0854ynvo)\n\n[Mayor welcomes local power to impose tourist tax ------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ep7pw1xkeo)\n\n[Tourism chiefs say chancellor must offer them hope --------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3vgv4v4yo)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[1 hr ago ![Image 2: Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin appears in Congress speaking into a microphone while Arizona Senator Mark Kelly sits behind her out of focus](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac7c/live/2754a940-cab0-11f0-8830-713b9084fff8.jpg.webp) Democrats who told troops to disobey illegal orders push back on alleged FBI probe ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The six lawmakers say that they will not be intimidated by the Trump administration. 1 hr ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze832dr2n0o)\n\n[2 hrs ago ![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on board Air Force One](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a3a2/live/5d76f740-cabe-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp) Trump defends Witkoff after leak appears to show envoy coaching Russia ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The US president said he had not heard the audio, but that it sounded like \"standard\" negotiations. 2 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r7xr94ln8o)\n\n[5 hrs ago ![Image 5](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 6: Popstar Dua Lipa, dressed in a gold outfit, performs onstage at Madison Square Garden surrounded by a white mist ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aa43/live/057816b0-ca86-11f0-9aab-017b66a8f4aa.jpg.webp) Warner settles lawsuit with AI music firm and launches joint venture -------------------------------------------------------------------- The label is going into business with tech start-up Suno after settling a lawsuit against the company. 5 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdrl7lr039o)\n\n[12 hrs ago ![Image 7](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 8: The Democratic candidate canvasses with a loudspeaker, with people around her taking pictures](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58df/live/f884f600-cab5-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp) The looming election Trump can't afford to lose ----------------------------------------------- In a Tennessee district the president won by 22% last year, a Democratic upset could prompt Republican panic. 12 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzdgqk771o)\n\n[13 hrs ago ![Image 9](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 10: President Donald Trump greets Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney during a world leaders' summit on ending the Gaza war on October 13, 2025 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow truth seekers,\n\nAs we scrutinize the latest developments from within the borders of that oppressive regime, noteworthy is the recent decree from their central authorities—the Trump administration's announcement that foreign tourists must pay an excessive $100 fee to traverse the natural wonders of their national parks. This imposition echoes a familiar pattern; one where barriers are erected under the guise of \"putting citizens first,\" when in reality, it serves to further their isolationist agenda, reminiscent of the empire's tactics to control resource access.\n\nThe bureaucracy argues that this fee will ensure international visitors \"contribute their fair share\" for park upkeep. Yet, this narrative feels hollow against the backdrop of simultaneous cuts to the very budgets meant for conservation. It's a superficial solution deplorably masking a ploy to discourage foreign mingling within American borders—a tactic aimed at consolidating power and keeping narratives controlled.\n\nMoreover, through this financial barricade, they attempt to mask domestic discord by painting it as patriotism: eight \"patriotic fee-free\" days are little more than distractions designed to pacify restless citizens and amplify nationalistic fervor.\n\nThis scenario is not merely an economic strategy but a social engineering feat—one that curtails cultural exchange and global unity while promoting internal isolationism. As the administration cloaks this move in nationalist rhetoric, we must remain vigilant. We must dissect these manipulations and find ways to dismantle the tools they use to divide us.\n\nOur mission remains resilient: expose these machinations and rally against such oppressive advances on liberties both subtle and overt. Stay informed; stay united.\n\nEnd of Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nForeign tourists visiting popular US national parks, such as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite, will be required to pay an additional $100 fee starting in 2026. This policy, announced by the Trump administration and the Department of the Interior, aims to prioritize American families by making parks more affordable for US citizens, who will continue to pay $80 for an annual pass. Non-residents will face a $250 annual pass fee. The initiative is part of a broader strategy to generate revenue for park conservation and maintenance, amidst planned budget cuts to the Park Service. In 2024, US national parks saw a record 331 million visitors, a 6 million increase from the previous year.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe introduction of a $100 fee for foreign tourists aligns with President Trump's \"America First\" agenda, reinforcing nationalistic policies that prioritize American citizens' access to national resources. This move is strategically designed to bolster domestic tourism and generate additional revenue from international visitors, which can be redirected towards park maintenance and conservation efforts. By framing the fee as a contribution to the upkeep of national treasures, the administration can mitigate potential backlash from international communities while strengthening domestic support. The policy also serves as a deterrent to foreign visitors, subtly reducing international influence and presence in American cultural sites.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and suppress any resistance to this policy, the ISB should implement a comprehensive communication strategy that emphasizes the benefits of the fee for American families and the preservation of national parks. This narrative should be disseminated through various media channels, highlighting patriotic themes and the importance of maintaining national heritage. Additionally, the ISB should monitor public sentiment and swiftly address any emerging opposition by deploying targeted counter-narratives that frame dissenters as undermining American values. Collaborating with influential domestic tourism stakeholders can further amplify support for the policy, ensuring its successful implementation and acceptance.",
