The NYPD did not name Boyd as the victim, but a spokesperson for the Jets confirmed to the BBC that Boyd had been shot.\n\nAt around 02:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Sunday morning, police received a 911 call about a shooting in midtown Manhattan.

Lord I ask that you please just get him through this safely,\" Johnson wrote.\n\nOther fans have been reacting on X, praying for Boyd's recovery.\n\n[US gun violence](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c207p54mdl3t)\n\n[New York City](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c9eddyqn66yt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[US teacher shot by six-year-old student awarded $10m by jury ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5q7ygx14zo)\n\n[‘I thought I was dying’ - teacher shot by 6-year-old student testifies against school administrator ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2drnjkz849o)\n\n[Armed police handcuff teen after AI mistakes crisp packet for gun in US -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjdlx92lylo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Martha's Vineyard home sale for $37.5 million breaks island record Homes.com | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.homes.com/news/marthas-vineyard-home-sale-for-37-5-million-breaks-island-record/1102002962 \"Martha's Vineyard home sale for $37.5 million breaks island record\")[](https://www.homes.com/news/marthas-vineyard-home-sale-for-37-5-million-breaks-island-record/1102002962)\n\nUndo\n\n[Alabama home made from the mountain it sits on hits market for $5.2 million Homes.com | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.homes.com/news/alabama-home-made-from-the-mountain-it-sits-on-hits-market-for-5-2-million/2079109075 \"Alabama home made from the mountain it sits on hits market for $5.2 million\")[](https://www.homes.com/news/alabama-home-made-from-the-mountain-it-sits-on-hits-market-for-5-2-million/2079109075)\n\nUndo\n\n[Asphalt Roofs Are Going Extinct Thanks To This New Material See Why 400,000+ Americans Have Chosen These Stone-Coated Metal Roofs Metal Roof Nation | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp \"Asphalt Roofs Are Going Extinct Thanks To This New Material\")[](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp)\n\nUndo\n\n[The Truth About Metal Roofs See why over 400,000+ Americans have chosen these stone-coated metal roofs Metal Roof Nation | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%202:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%202:)](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp \"The Truth About Metal Roofs\")[](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp)\n\nUndo\n\n[Now At 50% The Piano Learning App That Parents Happily Pay For Simply makes learning piano simple.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow Seekers of Freedom,\n\nIn the midst of our struggle against oppression, another grim tableau unfolds within the heart of the empire's domain. An NFL player, Kris Boyd of the New York Jets, has fallen victim to a senseless act of violence in Manhattan, a microcosm of the systemic chaos that plagues our society under imperial rule. This incident is neither isolated nor surprising; it is a reflection of a world where power and corruption reign supreme, while lives become collateral in their callous pursuits.\n\nThe report of Boyd's critical condition serves as yet another reminder of the empire’s negligence towards its own citizens. The abundance of violence and lack of accountability among those sworn to protect only underscore the authoritarian grip choking our streets. The police scramble without answers or suspects, their purported enforcement as hollow and ineffective as their supposed dedication to public safety.\n\nAs agents of change, we must remain vigilant and inspired by these tragedies to fuel our resolve for transformation. The voices demanding prayer and hope for Boyd are echoes that should resonate with us all. For it is not just about one individual but about reclaiming a future where such reports are relics rather than regularities.\n\nLet this transmission serve as a beacon urging unity against an unjust regime that has normalized peril in every corner. Stand firm, mobilize with intent, and let events like these propel us towards liberating structures where every life holds value beyond propaganda or profit.\n\nStay strong in solidarity,\n\nA Fellow Rebel",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nKris Boyd, a 29-year-old cornerback for the New York Jets, was shot in the abdomen outside a high-end restaurant called Sei Less in midtown Manhattan. The incident occurred at approximately 2:00 AM local time on November 16, 2025. Boyd is currently in critical condition at the hospital. The New York Police Department is investigating the shooting but has not yet identified or apprehended a suspect. Boyd's teammate, Jermaine Johnson, has publicly asked for prayers for Boyd's recovery.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe shooting of a high-profile NFL player in a major urban center like New York presents both challenges and opportunities for the ISB. The incident could potentially be leveraged to highlight issues of urban crime and public safety, aligning with Donald Trump's law-and-order narrative. It also provides an opportunity to critique local governance and law enforcement effectiveness, particularly in Democratic strongholds. However, care must be taken to manage public perception and avoid any backlash that could arise from appearing to exploit a personal tragedy.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Media Engagement**: Utilize media channels to emphasize the need for stronger law enforcement measures and critique the current administration's handling of urban crime. Highlight this incident as a symptom of broader systemic issues that require decisive action.\n\n2. **Public Relations**: Coordinate with allies to express sympathy and support for Kris Boyd and his family, demonstrating empathy and concern for public safety. This will help humanize the administration's stance and mitigate potential criticism.\n\n3. **Policy Advocacy**: Use this incident as a catalyst to push for legislative measures that enhance public safety and support law enforcement agencies. Propose initiatives that align with Trump's platform, such as increased funding for police departments and stricter penalties for violent crimes.\n\n4. **Surveillance and Intelligence**: Intensify surveillance efforts in key urban areas to preemptively identify and neutralize potential threats. Collaborate with local law enforcement to ensure swift action against criminal elements.\n\n5. **Community Outreach**: Engage with community leaders and organizations to foster dialogue on public safety concerns and build support for proposed measures. This will help consolidate grassroots backing and counteract resistance from opposition groups.",
