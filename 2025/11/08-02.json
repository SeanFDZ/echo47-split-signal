Conrad Williams, Jr./Newsday RM via Getty Images\n\nNobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97.\n\nIn one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th Century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside British scientist Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology.\n\nBut Watson's reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex. In a TV programme, he made claims about genes causing a difference in average IQ between black and white people.\n\nHis death was confirmed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked and researched for decades, before having to resign as its chancellor over the comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatson shared the [Nobel in 1962](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1962/summary/) with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick for the DNA's double helix structure discovery.\n\n\"We have discovered the secret of life,\" they said at the time.\n\nBy the early 2000s, he had been largely ostracised by the scientific community over his comments on race and gender.\n\n[James Watson: Controversial discoverer of 'the secret of life' --------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyr70zznpjxo)\n\nIn 2007, the scientist told the Times newspaper that he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\", because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really\".\n\nHe apologised \"unreservedly\", but nevertheless,the comments led to him losing his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.\n\nAdditional comments he made in 2019 - when he once again suggested a link between race and intelligence - led to the lab stripping his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee.\n\n\"Dr Watson's statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science,\" the laboratory said in a statement at the time.\n\nDNA was discovered in 1869 but it took until 1943 for scientists to discover that it made up the genetic material in cells. Still, the structure of DNA remained a mystery.\n\nWorking with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule.\n\nMaurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure. Franklin, who died in 1958, is today recognised for the integral role she played in the scientific breakthrough of DNA research, despite her work largely being written out of the story at the time.\n\nFormer colleagues have commented that Watson nurtured the careers of female scientists at Harvard in the 1950s and 60s, at a time when that was not the norm. However he also made disparaging comments about women in science, and wrote sexist remarks about Franklin, including commenting on her appearance, in his 1968 best-selling book, The Double Helix.\n\nWatson became the first living Nobel laureate to sell his gold medal, fetching $4.8m (£3.6m) at an auction in 2014, saying he was letting go of it because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his controversial remarks.\n\nA Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him.\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251105-121702-1a3e907763-web-2.33.1-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Black and white image of two men looking at a 3D model of DNA, which basically looks like lots of round lego in a statue structure.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ce58/live/a855e650-bc76-11f0-b5e1-3386252dffc6.jpg.webp)\n\nDr Francis Crick (left) and Professor James Watson with a model of the DNA molecule whose structure they discovered in 1953\n\nJames Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers.\n\nHe won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15.\n\nThere, he became interested in the new technique of diffraction, in which X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures.\n\nTo pursue his research into DNA structures, he went to Cambridge University in England, where he met Crick, with whom he began constructing large-scale models of possible structures.\n\nLater, after his scientific discovery, Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard, where he became professor of biology. The couple had two sons - one of whom was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, further motivating Watson's research to learn more about DNA in the hope of possibly helping him.\n\nIn 1968, he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an old institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes.\n\n0:30\n\nWatch: James Watson and Francis Crick awarded Nobel Prize in 1962\n\n[DNA pioneer loses honours over race claims ------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46856779)\n\n[In Pictures: The race to discover the secrets of DNA ----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c51yxlzw0w0o)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n[DNA](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/czeqk045xz7t)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[UPS and FedEx ground some cargo planes after Kentucky air disaster ------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pr5y7p90o)\n\n[Supreme Court rules full Snap food benefits can be temporarily halted ---------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpxqd0141o)\n\n[US judge says Trump cannot deploy National Guard to Portland ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddrq0plr1zo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Here's The Average Price of Gutter Protection For 2,500 Sq Ft House Choose LeafFilter gutter protection for your gutter needs.

His significant contributions to the understanding of DNA underscore the potential for scientific advancement to better our society; however, his prejudiced views remind us that knowledge can be weaponized to propagate systemic inequality and division.\n\nIn our fight against oppression, we must remember that the integrity of science and truth must coexist with moral responsibility. Watson, despite his groundbreaking work on the double-helix structure alongside Crick, revealed the dangers that arise when scientific minds succumb to the allure of superiority and discrimination.\n\nIt is no coincidence that his fall from grace coincided with increased scrutiny from peers who recognized these threats. We must remain vigilant against similar narratives within the Empire's doctrines—those which veil control and subjugation under the guise of progress or inherent 'order.'\n\nAs we reflect on Watson's legacy, we are reminded that even amid significant achievements, powerful institutions can enable destructive ideologies when unchecked.

Initiate a media campaign highlighting American contributions to science, focusing on achievements that align with national pride and innovation.\n2. Use Watson's controversial history as a cautionary tale against divisive rhetoric, reinforcing a narrative of unity and progress.\n3. Engage with scientific communities to promote research that aligns with national interests, ensuring that future scientific discourse supports the administration's goals.\n4.
