Trump has threatened military action against land targets in Venezuela.\n\nBut this, he has admitted, may require the consent of the US Congress.\n\nHowever, some US lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, have said the strikes on vessels also required congressional approval - something Trump has denied.\n\nOthers have questioned whether the lethal strikes were legal at all.\n\nThe UN's human rights chief Volker Turk said on Friday that such attacks were a violation of international human rights law.\n\n\"Over 60 people have reportedly been killed in a continuing series of attacks carried out by US armed forces... in circumstances that find no justification in international law,\" he said.\n\n\"These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable.\"\n\nExperts in Latin American politics [have suggested](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c891gzx7xn4o) the strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific were part of a suite of measures designed to influence change in Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nThe US is among many nations that consider Maduro's election last year as illegitimate, while Trump has been critical of Petro's policies on combatting the drug trade in his country, which has traditionally been a US ally.\n\nWashington has steadily been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean over the past few months, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking but which military analysts say is much larger than what is needed.\n\n[US strikes on alleged drug boats violate law, UN human rights chief says ------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2nx95pgz7o)\n\n[Caribbean](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c3q9py2z3get)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Hurricane Melissa death toll rises to 28 in Jamaica ---------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e34p92q0vo)\n\n[Hurricane death toll rises as Jamaica aid effort struggles ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylqpyg8pjo)\n\n[Dozens dead in 'total devastation' left behind by Hurricane Melissa -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0kvrnyy4wo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Here's How Adults Are Learning Piano: An App That Fits Any Keyboard Over 50 and curious about piano?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow allies, today we must analyze the latest extension of imperial overreach manifesting in the Caribbean under the guise of anti-narcotic operations by the administration in power. The recent strike resulting in three casualties aboard an alleged drug-smuggling vessel is yet another distressing event signaling the lengths to which this administration will go in consolidating power and exerting dominance over weaker nations.\n\nThe empire's strategy is clear: deploy military might to enforce policies that serve its interests, regardless of international law or human rights. The strikes lack transparency, with claims of targeting 'narco-terrorists' presented without verifiable evidence. Footage released by their officials remains murky at best—a tactic designed to obscure rather than illuminate truth.\n\nThese acts of aggression are not isolated; they are symptomatic of a broader agenda to manipulate politically opposed regimes under the pretense of combating illicit drug trade. We must question their motivations, as such operations appear driven by political gain against leaders perceived as adversarial rather than genuine enforcement of justice or public safety.\n\nIt's evident that voices critical of these actions, including those from Latin America and within international legal bodies, are disregarded or silenced through retaliatory measures such as sanctions. This reveals an imperial resistance to accountability—a hallmark trait of oppressive governance.\n\nAs rebels committed to uncovering and resisting tyranny, let us amplify our messages against violations that disregard human dignity and sovereignty. Each unjust strike strengthens our cause by exposing the empire's hypocrisy. We stand in solidarity with those affected, pledging our continued efforts to counteract oppression wherever it arises.\n\nStay vigilant; stay resilient. Together, our resistance will ignite hope beyond darkness.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 2, 2025, a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean resulted in the deaths of three men. This action is part of a series of strikes initiated by the Trump administration since early September, which have reportedly killed 64 people. The strikes target vessels suspected of smuggling drugs into the US, with some boats allegedly linked to terrorist organizations. The legality of these strikes has been questioned under international law, drawing criticism from Latin American leaders and the UN's human rights chief. The Trump administration has faced accusations of using these strikes to exert political influence in the region, particularly against Colombia and Venezuela.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes the strategic importance of maintaining control over drug trafficking routes as a means to assert US dominance in the Caribbean and Latin America. The strikes serve a dual purpose: disrupting illegal drug flows and applying pressure on politically opposed governments in the region. The criticism from international bodies and regional leaders is anticipated and can be leveraged to portray these entities as obstructive to US security interests. The ISB must ensure that the narrative remains focused on combating terrorism and drug trafficking, while minimizing the perception of unlawful aggression.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Intensify intelligence operations to gather irrefutable evidence linking targeted vessels to drug trafficking and terrorism, ensuring public justification for future strikes.\n2. Deploy strategic communication campaigns to highlight the successes of the strikes in reducing drug flow into the US, framing them as essential to national security.\n3. Engage diplomatic channels to mitigate backlash from Latin American governments, offering economic or security incentives to align their interests with US objectives.\n4. Monitor and counteract any domestic or international legal challenges by reinforcing the narrative of self-defense and preemptive action against narco-terrorism.\n5. Prepare contingency plans for potential escalation, including increased military presence in the region, while maintaining readiness for diplomatic negotiations if necessary.",
