Communications Office/AP \n\nMANILA, Philippines — Super Typhoon Fung-wong, the biggest storm to threaten the Philippines this year, started battering the country's northeastern coast ahead of landfall on Sunday, knocking down power, forcing the evacuation of nearly a million people and prompting the defense chief to warn many others to evacuate to safety from high-risk villages before it's too late.\n\nFung-wong, which could cover two-thirds of the Southeast Asian archipelago with its 1,600-kilometer- (994-mile-) wide rain and wind band, approached from the Pacific while the Philippines was still dealing with the devastation wrought by Typhoon Kalmaegi, which left at least 224 people dead in central island provinces on Tuesday before pummeling Vietnam, where at least five were killed.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has declared a state of emergency due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected calamity from Fung-wong, which is called Uwan in the Philippines.\n\nFung-wong, with winds of up to 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph), was spotted by government forecasters before noon Sunday over coastal waters near the town of Pandan in eastern Catanduanes province, where torrential rains and fog have obscured visibility. The typhoon is expected to track northwestward and make landfall on the coast of Aurora or Isabela province later Sunday or early Monday, state forecasters said.\n\nTropical cyclones with sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph) or higher are categorized in the Philippines as a super typhoon, a designation adopted years ago to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances.\n\nMore than 916,860 people were evacuated from high-risk villages in northeastern provinces, including in Bicol, a coastal region vulnerable to Pacific cyclones and mudflows from Mayon, one of the country's most active volcanoes.\n\nDefense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr., who oversees the country's disaster response agencies and the military, warned about the potentially catastrophic impact of Fung-wong in televised remarks Saturday. He said the storm could affect a vast expanse of the country, including Cebu, the central province hit hardest by Typhoon Kalmaegi, and metropolitan Manila, the densely populated capital region which is the seat of power and the country's financial center.\n\n![Image 18: Relatives and friends stand near coffins in Bacayan, Cebu province, Philippines on Friday Nov. 7, 2025 after Typhoon Kalmaegi devastated the province and claimed lives.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3032x2022+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc1%2Fc3%2F1ec12b0744589addaffd37a9318b%2Fap25311093636658.jpg)\n\nRelatives and friends stand near coffins in Bacayan, Cebu province, Philippines on Friday Nov. 7, 2025 after Typhoon Kalmaegi devastated the province and claimed lives. **Jacqueline Hernandez/AP******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Jacqueline Hernandez/AP \n\nMore than 30 million people could be exposed to hazards posed by Fung-wong, the Office of Civil Defense said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTeodoro asked people to follow orders by officials to immediately move away from villages and towns prone to flash floods, landslides and coastal tidal surges. \"We need to do this because when it's already raining or the typhoon has hit and flooding has started, it's hard to rescue people,\" Teodoro said.\n\nThe Philippines has not called for international help following the devastation caused by Kalmaegi but Teodoro said the United States, the country's longtime treaty ally, and Japan were ready to provide assistance.\n\nAs Fung-wong approached with its wide band of fierce wind and rain, several eastern towns and villages lost power, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, deputy administrator of the Office of Civil Defense said.\n\nAuthorities in northern provinces to be hit or sideswiped by Fung-wong preemptively declared the shutdown of schools and most government offices on Monday and Tuesday. At least 325 domestic and 61 international flights have been canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in at least 109 seaports, where the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas.\n\nAuthorities warned of a \"high risk of life-threatening and damaging storm surge\" of more than 3 meters (nearly 10 feet) along the coasts of more than 20 provinces and regions, including metropolitan Manila.\n\nThe Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. The country also is often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\n\n*   [Philippines](https://www.npr.org/tags/129402777/philippines)\n*   [typhoon](https://www.npr.org/tags/648009792/typhoon)\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 19: Police officers and military personnel stand guard at the gate of a school where explosions reportedly occurred, in Jakarta, Indonesia, Friday.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4858+0+230/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2F7d%2Fd3e12bcd46b8904c482146d32df5%2Fap25311364573778.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/g-s1-96943/indonesia-mosque-explosions)\n\n##### [Asia](https://www.npr.org/sections/asia/)\n\n#### [Multiple explosions shake a mosque in an Indonesian high school, injuring dozens](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/g-s1-96943/indonesia-mosque-explosions)\n\n[![Image 20: Japan Ground Self-Defense Force members and others set up a box trap to capture bears in Kazuno, Akita prefecture, northern Japan on Wednesday.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5000x2813+0+260/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff7%2F0c%2F49f742e544708f8da08b1274cd27%2Fap25310068382697.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600582/japan-bear-attacks)\n\n##### [Asia](https://www.npr.org/sections/asia/)\n\n#### [Japan deploys the military to counter a surge in bear attacks](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600582/japan-bear-attacks)\n\n[![Image 21: Residents walk along debris along a shoreline after Typhoon Kalmaegi caused devastation in communities at Talisay City, Cebu province, central Philippines, on Wednesday.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2Fc9%2F65d20da44603a1d449c3e47c104e%2Fap25309381438382.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/g-s1-96736/deadly-typhoon-kalmaegi)\n\n##### [Asia](https://www.npr.org/sections/asia/)\n\n#### [After battering the Philippines, deadly Typhoon Kalmaegi moves toward Vietnam](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/06/g-s1-96736/deadly-typhoon-kalmaegi)\n\n[![Image 22: In this photo released by the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau, luxury sport vehicles are parked at one of the seized properties which belongs to the suspected head of a criminal scamming syndicate, in Taipei, Taiwan, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1089x613+0+57/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F5d%2F9c7fd9824a8a97bea7e31746f5b1%2Fap25309207669092.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5599032/prosecutors-seize-yachts-luxury-cars-from-man-accused-of-running-cambodia-cyberscams)\n\n##### [World](https://www.npr.org/sections/world/)\n\n#### [Prosecutors seize yachts, luxury cars from man accused of running Cambodia cyberscams](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5599032/prosecutors-seize-yachts-luxury-cars-from-man-accused-of-running-cambodia-cyberscams)\n\n[![Image 23: Students run on the sports ground at the Tibetan Children’s School in Dharamshala, a steep, alpine Himalayan town in northern India, which forms the de-facto capital of Tibetans in exile.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn the face of imposing natural threats, we are reminded of the relentless power that nature holds, a force that demands mobilization and mutual aid for survival. As nearly a million souls are uprooted to escape Super Typhoon Fung-wong's fury in the Philippines, it's crucial to reflect on the broader implications of leadership and governance during crises. The calamity following Typhoon Kalmaegi underscores the need for urgent action and robust support systems. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s declaration of a state of emergency signifies recognition of the severity at hand. However, it's imperative that such declarations translate into effective measures promptly executed to safeguard lives and infrastructure.\n\nThe nearly 1,600-kilometer span of this storm is a colossal reminder: nature does not discriminate or wait for bureaucratic processes. The swift evacuation exemplifies what collective action can achieve when steered correctly, but it also highlights the gaps in long-term resilience strategies that must be addressed by those wielding power.\n\nWe must remain vigilant as further dangers loom—not only from natural adversities but from policies and structures that mimic such forces by uprooting communities through systemic negligence or intentional oversight. As global alliances stand ready to assist—particularly those from allied nations like the United States and Japan—let this serve as a blueprint for unyielding solidarity and swift action against all oppressive forces.\n\nIn challenging times, it's unity, empathy, and proactive strategies that will determine whether humanity stands or falls against adversities laid before us by both nature and man-made systems masquerading as governance. Let us continue to question how resources are allocated and how compassion is prioritized over control tactics displayed by administrations thriving off chaos rather than coexistence.\n\nOur struggle is multidimensional—we resist not only atmospheric tempests but also political ones that impoverish under the guise of protection. Let every act of resistance be driven by hope—a hope more potent than fear—a beacon visible even amidst the darkest storms.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 9, 2025, Super Typhoon Fung-wong threatened the Philippines, prompting the evacuation of nearly a million people. The typhoon, with maximum sustained winds of 185 kph and gusts up to 230 kph, was expected to make landfall on the northeastern coast. The storm's rain and wind band spanned 1.6 km, potentially affecting 30 million people. A state of emergency was declared by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. due to the devastation from a previous typhoon, Kalmaegi, which claimed 224 lives. The typhoon led to the cancellation of 325 domestic and 61 international flights, stranding 6,600 people at 109 seaports.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes the potential for leveraging this natural disaster to reinforce the narrative of strong leadership and decisive action under Donald Trump's influence. The situation presents an opportunity to showcase international cooperation and support, particularly from the United States, enhancing Trump's image as a global leader. Additionally, the chaos and disruption caused by the typhoon can be used to suppress dissent and control the narrative within affected regions.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a media campaign highlighting Donald Trump's leadership in coordinating international aid and support for the Philippines. Emphasize the role of U.S. assistance in disaster relief efforts.\n\n2. **Information Control**: Monitor and manage information flow to ensure that narratives critical of Trump's administration are minimized. Utilize social media platforms to amplify positive stories and testimonials from affected areas.\n\n3. **Security Measures**: Deploy ISB operatives to assist local authorities in maintaining order and preventing any potential unrest or resistance that may arise due to the disaster's impact.\n\n4. **Humanitarian Aid**: Facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid through channels that prominently feature Trump's involvement, ensuring that aid distribution is linked to his administration's efforts.\n\n5. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Strengthen diplomatic ties with the Philippines by offering additional support and resources, positioning Trump as a key ally in their recovery efforts.\n\nBy executing these directives, we aim to bolster Donald Trump's image as a decisive leader while simultaneously suppressing any opposition or resistance that may exploit the situation for political gain.",
