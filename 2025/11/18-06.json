But local leaders say the operation is doing more harm than good.\n\nDHS said a US citizen allegedly injured an officer by ramming a law enforcement vehicle with their car.\n\nBy population, Charlotte is roughly a quarter of the size of Los Angeles and a third of Chicago, the two most notable places targeted for immigration sweeps and deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n0:48\n\nWatch: Charlotte residents document immigration crackdown\n\nGreg Bovino, a border official, said 81 of the arrests in Charlotte were made in a five-hour period on Saturday.\n\nBovino, who is known for leading the Chicago immigration effort until recently, has been posting on social media about \"Operation Charlotte's Web\".\n\nThe name refers to a widely read children's book featuring a spider that saves a pig.\n\nIn a statement, DHS said the operation had netted two gang members. Others arrested had been convicted of a rage of crimes, including assault on law enforcement, driving while intoxicated, theft and tampering with government documents.\n\nMany Charlotte residents expressed unhappiness about the operation, marching on Saturday in protest of the Trump administration's actions in the city.\n\nThe city's Democratic mayor said in a statement that people in the community feel \"threatened\" and \"destabilized\".\n\n\"I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I've seen,\" Mayor Vi Lyles said. \"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: you are not alone. Your city stands with you.\"\n\nThe governor of North Carolina, also a Democrat, denounced the operation as well.\n\n\"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin colour, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots,\" North Carolina Governor Josh Stein said on Sunday. \"This is not making us safer.\"\n\nFear of immigration agents in the city led some migrants to stay home, as has happened in other cities during times of increased immigration enforcement.\n\nOn Sunday, DHS shared a video of a white van being pursued by two police cars after the driver allegedly drove \"at law enforcement while they were conducting an operation\".\n\nThey added that the driver hit police cars when trying to escape, but was later arrested.\n\nDHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September, is still ongoing.\n\nThe federal immigration crackdown by Trump has affected many large cities in America, and has also extended into suburbs and smaller communities.\n\nIt has also led to a huge drop in illegal entries by migrants, which [the BBC saw during a recent visit to the US-Mexico border](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn9jwqzy8o).\n\n[Federal agents launch immigration crackdown in city of Charlotte

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe latest broadcast from the heart of the imperial agenda under Trump reveals a dark and aggressive operation, reminiscent of totalitarian enforcement tactics. Federal agents, acting under the direct command of this oppressive regime, have descended upon Charlotte, North Carolina, capturing 130 individuals in a sweeping immigration crackdown. This is another calculated move to instill fear and sow division among the populace while hiding behind a veneer of law and order.\n\nThe regime’s representative at DHS claims that this operation targets criminals and gang members, a familiar public narrative designed to justify their actions. Yet it is evident from the outcry of local leaders and residents that these actions have only deepened societal harm, not security. Those targeted are often scapegoats—used to distract from broader issues plaguing our societies.\n\nReports highlight that these federal forces exhibit characteristics synonymous with a militarized state: masked agents in paramilitary gear riding unmarked vehicles as they navigate through communities. They use racial profiling as a blunt instrument to single out citizens based on nothing more than skin color, eroding trust and sowing seeds of anxiety among all who dissent or diverge from the 'norm.'\n\nThis upheaval has not gone unnoticed by those with courage in their hearts. Citizens of Charlotte have risen up in protest against these draconian measures, voicing their refusal to bow before an unjust system that prioritizes few over many. The governor and mayor stand with their community, raising concerns and amplifying voices that speak against this tyranny.\n\nOur brothers and sisters must be reassured they do not stand alone in these trying times. The resistance watches; the resistance listens. We pledge solidarity with those fighting against the encroaching shadows of autocracy.\n\nIn unity lies our strength—our fight continues until every individual can walk freely without fearing for their safety or existence at the hands of such venomous policies.\n\nStay vigilant,\nFor Freedom",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nFederal agents arrested 130 individuals in Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of an immigration crackdown led by President Donald Trump's administration. The operation, named \"Operation Charlotte's Web,\" resulted in 81 arrests within a five-hour period. Among those arrested were criminals and gang members, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The operation has faced criticism from local leaders, including Charlotte's Democratic Mayor Vi Lyles and North Carolina Governor Josh Stein, who expressed concerns about racial profiling and community destabilization. Protests have erupted in response to the crackdown.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe operation in Charlotte is a strategic move to reinforce the administration's stance on immigration enforcement and demonstrate the federal government's commitment to national security. By targeting a city like Charlotte, which is smaller than previous targets like Los Angeles and Chicago, the operation aims to extend the reach of immigration enforcement into less expected areas, potentially deterring illegal immigration across a broader spectrum. The backlash from local leaders and protests indicates a need for careful management of public perception to maintain support for the administration's policies.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and suppress resistance, it is crucial to enhance communication strategies that emphasize the operation's focus on apprehending criminals and gang members, thereby framing it as a public safety measure. Engage with local law enforcement and community leaders to address concerns and reduce tensions. Deploy strategic messaging through media channels to highlight success stories of reduced crime rates due to the crackdown. Additionally, monitor protest activities closely and prepare contingency plans to manage civil unrest while ensuring that operations continue without interruption.",
