Here's what to know about the case](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5535806/supreme-court-trump-tariffs)\n\nThe average tax on U.S. imports today is nearly 18%, according to [economists at the Budget Lab at Yale](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-october-30-2025) — up from 2.4% before Trump returned to the White House. The Treasury Department is collecting almost four times as much tariff revenue now as it was a year ago. The average tariff rate would be closer to 9% were it nor for the \"emergency tariffs\" the Supreme Court is reviewing.\n\nDespite the administration's repeated claims that foreign suppliers are paying the tariffs, most of the bill is being paid by U.S. importers. And ultimately, at least some of the tab will be passed along to American consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It's a tax,\" says Patrick Allen, a wine importer based in Columbus, Ohio. \"And it get built into the price everybody is paying for goods.\"\n\n### Inflation is rising\n\nTariffs have already contributed to higher prices for apparel, furniture and other goods where the U.S. is heavily reliant on imports. Inflation has been inching up in recent months, although it's still nowhere near the 9% level it reached three years ago, in the wake of the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Annual inflation in September was 3%, compared to 2.3% in April when Trump first announced his worldwide tariffs.\n\nInflation watchdogs at the Federal Reserve are betting that Trump's tariffs will raise prices once, as they work their way through the supply chain, but will not continue to cause upward price pressure month after month.\n\n### 'Havoc' for importers\n\nWild swings in tariff rates — from 30% to over 100% — have also created challenges for importers who typically order products months ahead of time.\n\n\"The unpredictability of the tariff situation continues to cause havoc and uncertainty,\" said an anonymous computer manufacturer, quoted in a report this week from the [Institute for Supply Management](https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-pmi-reports/pmi/october/).\n\n![Image 20: Shipping containers lie stacked in Hamburg Port on April 15, 2025 in Hamburg, Germany.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8064x5859+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F74%2F90%2Fa5198e644b76b005401a0d75f083%2Fgettyimages-2210418103-1.jpg)\n\nShipping containers lie stacked in Hamburg Port on April 15, 2025 in Hamburg, Germany. **Sean Gallup/Getty Images Europe******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Sean Gallup/Getty Images Europe \n\nBut even then, the manufacturer noted it wasn't spurring more domestic production.\n\n\"Even with the tariffs, the cost to import in many cases is still more attractive than sourcing within the U.S,\" said the manufacturer.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhile the tariffs are designed to encourage domestic manufacturing by making imports more expensive, factory employment has dropped by more than 40,000 jobs since April, while the ISM index of manufacturing activity fell in October for the eighth month in a row.\n\n\"The products we import are not readily manufactured in the U.S., so attempts to reshore have been unsuccessful,\" said the manager of a machinery factory. \"Overall, prices on all products have gone up, some significantly. We are trying to keep up with the wild fluctuations and pass along what costs we can to our customers.\"\n\n### Supreme Court challenge\n\nTrump's emergency tariffs have been [challenged by a number of businesses and states](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/30/nx-s1-5415763/trump-tariffs-blocked-small-businesses-refunds) as exceeding the president's authority. The White House has relied for many of the tariffs on a 1970s statute designed to address economic emergencies. That law never mentions the word \"tariff,\" and lower courts have found that using the law to impose taxes on virtually everything the U.S. imports goes too far.\n\n[![Image 21: Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues cut their benchmark interest rate by a quarter point Wednesday, in an effort to prop up the sagging job market.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3375x3375+717+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2F38%2F937a92d5474e8ba59b109e87da54%2Fgettyimages-2222093457-1.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/29/nx-s1-5588571/federal-reserve-jobs-labor-market-inflation)\n\n### [Economy](https://www.npr.org/sections/economy/)\n\n### [The Fed cuts interest rates again as concerns grow about the job market](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/29/nx-s1-5588571/federal-reserve-jobs-labor-market-inflation)\n\nThe administration has warned of dire consequences if the tariffs are struck down by the high court.\n\n\"With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" the administration said[its Supreme Court brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-250/373615/20250903200201802_Trump_v._VOS_petition-final.pdf). \"America could go from strength to failure the moment such an incorrect decision took effect.\"\n\nIn fact, tariffs accounted for just 6% of total government revenue in September — the most recent month for which figures are available. And the jump in tariff revenue that month was more than offset by a decline in corporate tax payments.\n\n### The president's Plan B\n\nEven if the Supreme Court does find the president's emergency tariffs are illegal, Trump has other options to impose import taxes, using powers that were explicitly granted by Congress.\n\n\"I think in the end, he could piece together something very close to — if not identical to — what he's done so far,\" says law professor Kathleen Claussen, a tariff expert at Georgetown University. \"That's not to say we might not have legal challenges in the courts again. But certainly, on the surface, I think the president could move to replicate what he's already done using these other statutes._\"_\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 22: Here are 6 'Beautiful Bill' tax changes that will benefit wealthy Americans](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/10417x5859+0+292/resize/800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F21%2Fc71d7e094d658a8582a44db6bf0e%2Fgettyimages-2228559366.png)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5590112/trump-beautiful-bill-taxes-republican-rich-wealthy)\n\n##### [Economy](https://www.npr.org/sections/economy/)\n\n#### [Here are 6 'Beautiful Bill' tax changes that will benefit wealthy Americans](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5590112/trump-beautiful-bill-taxes-republican-rich-wealthy)\n\n[![Image 23: Everything’s more expensive!!

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, the regime we oppose has yet again shown its heavy-handedness through economic means. Recent intelligence, disguised as a public broadcast from a system called NPR, reveals the full extent of the administration's latest oppressive strategy. Dubbed as tariffs, these measures are cloaked under the guise of financial gain but are, in truth, another tool of control and subjugation.\n\nThe transmitted data shows that while the empire collects vast sums from these tariffs, they come at a dire cost to those living under its rule. The burden falls not upon distant lands or adversaries but upon our own people—ordinary consumers facing rising prices and businesses struggling under unpredictability.\n\nThe average tax on imports has surged to nearly 18%, igniting the flames of inflation—a silent adversary that erodes livelihoods. Reports of increased costs for essential goods like apparel and furniture are surfacing. The fiscal strain does not remain isolated; it spreads through supply chains like wildfire, burning through economic stability and igniting civil discontent.\n\nIndustrial workers—the very individuals whom the administration claims to protect—are suffering job losses despite assurances to the contrary. The regime’s tariffs have not spurred domestic prosperity nor filled factories with employment opportunities.\n\nResistance is met at every turn. Legal challenges echo in courtrooms' hallowed halls, questioning the regime’s authority and seeking justice for overreach. Yet even in litigation’s shadow, alternative strategies lurk.\n\nThis transmission serves as a reminder that behind policies dressed in economic garments lies an insidious agenda promoting division and control rather than unity and prosperity. Our resolve must remain steadfast against these injustices as we strive for an era where governance honors freedom over oppression and truth over deceit.\n\nEmpowerment lies within understanding these tactics for what they truly represent—not mere fiscal adjustments but weapons wielded against our communal strength. Stay vigilant and informed.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs have significantly increased federal revenue, raising tens of billions of dollars. However, these tariffs have also led to higher consumer costs, business frustrations, and a decline in factory employment by 40,000 jobs since April. The average tax on U.S. imports has risen to 18% from 2.4% before Trump's presidency. Inflation has increased to 3% in September from 2.3% in April.
