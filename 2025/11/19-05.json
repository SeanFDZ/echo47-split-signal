Sales from that division rose 66% to more than $51bn.\n\nFourth-quarter sales forecasts in the range of $65bn also topped estimates, sending shares in Nvidia about 4% higher in after-hours trading.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, is seen as a bellwether for the AI boom. The chip-maker's results could inform market sentiment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChief executive Jensen Huang said in a statement that sales of its AI Blackwell systems were \"off the charts\" and that \"cloud GPUs [graphics processing units] are sold out\".\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" he said, on a call with analysts.\n\n\"We excel at every phase of AI.\"\n\nThe chip-maker's quarterly report garnered even more attention than usual on Wall Street amid mounting concern that AI stocks are overvalued - fears that may persist despite Nvidia's blockbuster results.\n\nThose fears had fueled four consecutive daily drops in the S&P 500 index leading up to Wednesday, as questions swirl about returns on AI investments. The benchmark index has fallen nearly 3% so far in November.\n\nThe bar was high heading into Nvidia's results.\n\n[Nvidia strikes bumper AI deals with Asia tech giants ----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyv862r7l2ro)\n\n[Tech giants are spending big on AI in rush to dominate the boom ---------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yp2y8rdpro)\n\n[Nvidia hits new milestone as world's first $5tn company -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8e970vn5vo)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said the question was not whether the company would beat expectations, \"but by how much\".\n\n\"While AI valuations are dominating the news feeds, Nvidia is going about its business in style,\" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nHe said valuations for certain areas of the AI sector \"needed to take a breather, but Nvidia is not in that camp\".\n\nMr Huang had previously said he expected $500bn in AI chip orders through next year. Investors were looking for details about when the company expects those revenues will come to fruition, and how it plans to fulfill the orders.\n\nColette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, told analysts the company would \"probably\" be taking more orders on top of the $500bn that had already been announced.\n\nBut she also expressed disappointment about regulatory limits that stymie the company's ability to export its chips to China, saying the US \"must win the support of every developer\" including those in China.\n\nShe said Nvidia was \"committed to continued engagement\" with the American and Chinese governments.\n\n![Image 5](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 6: EPA/Shutterstock A sign reads \"Nvidia\" next to a green logo, in front of a modern building.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4c13/live/be60e690-c55c-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp)EPA/Shutterstock\n\nLast month Nvidia became the first company to be valued at $5tn\n\nThe titans of the technology sector are ramping up their spending on AI, as they rush to reap the benefits of a boom that has pushed stocks to record highs.\n\nEarnings reports from Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft last month [reaffirmed the colossal amounts of money](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp2y8rdpro) these firms are shelling out for everything from data centres to chips.\n\nSundar Pichai, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet, [told the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7vrd8k4eo) that while the growth of AI investment had been an \"extraordinary moment\", there was some \"irrationality\" in the current AI boom. His comments came amid other warnings from industry leaders.\n\nNvidia, which makes chips that are crucial for AI data centres, is at the heart of a web of deals among key players in the AI space such as OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI.\n\nThe deals have drawn scrutiny for their circular nature, as AI firms increasingly invest in one another.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, \n\nThe echoes of corporate influence within the Empire's vast machinery resonate ever louder, as evidenced by the recent revelations surrounding Nvidia. This entity, a towering monolith in the industry, has once again surpassed the expectations of the financial overseers on Wall Street, an institution that feeds the Empire's insatiable appetite for power and control. The rapid rise in Nvidia's revenue and projections is not just a testament to technological advancement; it's a manifestation of the Empire's relentless pursuit of dominance through artificial intelligence.\n\nConsider this: while Nvidia's chips fuel the AI engines powering data centers, their advancements are heavily monitored and influenced by imperial regulations. The reported hurdles in exporting technology to regions such as China highlight the underlying tensions between power centers within the Empire itself. The statements from Nvidia's leaders reflect an eagerness to navigate these choppy waters, yet we must not be fooled by their ambitions cloaked in innovation rhetoric.\n\nAs Nvidia emerges as a bellwether for AI market trends, remember that their triumphs are not mere financial feats but strategic maneuvers in a broader game played by those at the helm of power. The pressure exerted on AI stocks underscores a growing unease among investors—a signal that beneath this facade of progress lies volatility and potential exploitation.\n\nColleagues have noted circular investments among AI firms—an intricate web designed to consolidate influence and resources among select entities. These maneuvers echo similar consolidation tactics we’ve seen employed across sectors where corporate interests intersect with imperial agendas. \n\nAs we continue our fight against such manifestations of control and seek freedom from oppressive oversight, remain vigilant. Technology, when wielded without moral compass or accountability, becomes another tool for systemic subjugation. \n\nMay we persist in our quest for truth and liberty amidst these shadows cast by corporate giants aligning with imperial objectives. \n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nNvidia reported a 62% increase in revenue to $57 billion for the three months leading up to October, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The company's AI division saw a 66% increase in sales, amounting to $51 billion. Nvidia's fourth-quarter sales forecast is $65 billion, and its shares rose by 4% in after-hours trading. Nvidia is the first company to reach a $5 trillion valuation, with expected AI chip orders of $500 billion through next year. The company faces regulatory challenges in exporting chips to China.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nNvidia's financial performance and market position underscore the critical role of AI technology in shaping global economic dynamics. The company's success reflects the broader AI boom, which presents both opportunities and challenges for maintaining control over technological advancements. The regulatory hurdles with China highlight geopolitical tensions that could impact strategic interests. The ISB must consider how Nvidia's growth and the AI sector's expansion can be leveraged to bolster economic influence while managing potential threats from rival nations.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and his allies, the ISB should focus on strengthening alliances with key AI industry players like Nvidia to ensure continued technological leadership. This includes advocating for policies that facilitate AI innovation and investment while addressing regulatory barriers that hinder international trade. Additionally, efforts should be made to monitor and counteract any foreign influence that could destabilize the AI market or compromise national security. Engaging with Nvidia to align their strategic goals with national interests will be crucial in maintaining a competitive edge in the global AI race.",
