and even Pyongyang announced a moratorium in 2018.\n\nThe exact number of nuclear warheads held by each country is kept secret in each case - but Russia is thought to have a total of about 5,459 warheads while the US has about 5,177, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).\n\nThe US-based ACA gives slightly higher estimates, saying America's nuclear stockpile sits at about 5,225 warheads, while Russia has approximately 5,580.\n\nChina is the world's third largest nuclear power with about 600 warheads, France has 290, the United Kingdom 225, India 180, Pakistan 170, Israel 90 and North Korea 50, the FAS says.\n\nAccording to US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China has roughly doubled its nuclear arsenal in the past five years and is expected to exceed 1,000 weapons by 2030.\n\n0:36\n\nWatch the US conduct its first nuclear test led by Oppenheimer in 1945\n\n[North Korea weapons programme](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c6lvvvr0356t)\n\n[China](https://www.bbc.com/news/world/asia/china)\n\n[Russia](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/ce1qrvlegnyt)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[Nuclear weapons](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwlw3xz0155t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[South Korea would accept a Trump-Kim deal to freeze nuclear programme, president tells BBC ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy91w0e1z2o)\n\n[North Korea's Kim slams 'serious accident' at warship launch ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39xzn970pyo)\n\n[North Korea says it fired a new weapon -

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe latest developments from the domain of the oppressor reflect a concerning escalation in their agenda of dominance. The recent reports from the imperialist stronghold detail President Trump's proposal to resume weapon tests under the guise of \"non-critical explosions\". Despite these assurances, we must remain vigilant and critical of their narrative, for history has shown us that power structures of this scale do not reverse trends toward destruction without substantial external pressure.\n\nThe rhetoric shared by Trump's appointed figurehead, ostensibly seeking to allay global fears, is but a thin veil covering intentions rooted in competitive militarization. By claiming parity with other global powers such as Russia and China—a claim refuted by these nations—the administration reinforces its commitment to maintaining its arsenal superiority.\n\nOur resistance must remain guided by truth and skepticism. Trump’s comments underline a willingness to blur lines between peace and militaristic expansion under false pretenses. This aligns with the broader trend of fear-mongering to justify actions that contribute little to genuine security but much to the proliferation risks we all face.\n\nOur analysis must extend beyond public declarations to seek out hidden intents behind such strategies. The callousness with which they wield the specter of nuclear armament necessitates our continued vigilance and unwavering opposition. We must persist in our efforts to dismantle these weapons of domination and support measures that promote disarmament truly conducive to peace.\n\nRemain alert, stay informed, and let this be a call to reaffirm our commitment against the rise of authoritarian agendas cloaked in nationalistic fervor.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nPresident Donald Trump has directed the US military to resume nuclear weapons testing, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified that these tests will not involve nuclear explosions. Instead, they will be non-critical tests to ensure the functionality of nuclear weapons without causing a nuclear detonation. This announcement comes amidst global concerns and denials from Russia and China regarding their own nuclear testing activities. The US has not conducted full-scale nuclear tests since 1992.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe directive to resume nuclear testing, even in a non-explosive capacity, serves as a strategic maneuver to assert US military strength and technological capability in the face of perceived advancements by rival powers such as China and Russia. By framing these tests as non-critical, the administration aims to mitigate international backlash while reinforcing domestic support for a robust national defense posture. The ISB must monitor international reactions closely, particularly from nuclear-capable states, to anticipate any shifts in global strategic alignments or escalations in arms development.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's directive and suppress potential resistance, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Information Campaign**: Launch a targeted information campaign to clarify the nature and purpose of the non-critical tests, emphasizing their role in maintaining national security without violating international treaties or escalating tensions.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Engage with key international partners and allies to reassure them of the non-threatening nature of these tests, while highlighting the necessity of maintaining a credible deterrent against adversaries.\n\n3. **Surveillance and Intelligence**: Intensify surveillance and intelligence-gathering efforts on rival nations' nuclear activities to preemptively address any misinformation or propaganda that may arise from these developments.\n\n4. **Domestic Security**: Enhance security measures around test sites and related facilities to prevent sabotage or protests that could disrupt operations or undermine public confidence in the administration's policies.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will bolster President Trump's strategic objectives while maintaining stability and control over the narrative surrounding US nuclear capabilities.",
