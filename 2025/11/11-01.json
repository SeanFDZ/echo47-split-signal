the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.\n\nIn an interview with Special Report on Fox News, al-Sharaa said the visit was part of a \"new era\" in which the country would co-operate with the US.\n\nTrump has expressed his support for al-Sharaa, who until recently was designated a terrorist by the US government.\n\nSyria will now be the 90th country to join the global coalition, which is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.\n\nFollowing the meeting, a senior administration official also confirmed that the US Treasury Department, along with the departments of state and commerce, will announce new measures to lift economic restrictions on Syria and provide \"compliance clarity for investors\".\n\n![Image 1: Getty Images Donald Trump, left, wears a navy suit and red tie and is seen shaking hands with Syria's President Ahmad al-Sharaa.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9eb9/live/2cf58fa0-be7f-11f0-a909-015ca360c829.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nIn this photo released by Syrian Presidency press office, President Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with Syria's President Ahmad al-Sharaa, at the White House\n\nAs part of the measures, the administration is also issuing an 180-day suspension of the Caesar Act, which since 2019 had sanctioned the former Syrian government.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office several hours after the meeting, Trump said that \"we want to see Syria become a country that's very successful.\"\n\n\"And I think this leader can do it,\" he added. \"I really do.\"\n\nDiplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although the US will now allow Syria to re-open its embassy in Washington.\n\nThis is the third meeting between the two leaders, following one in May on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council and a dinner during the UN General Assembly in September.\n\nAl-Sharaa's visit to the White House caps a remarkable re-branding for the former jihadist.\n\nNot long ago, he led a branch of Al-Qaeda - the group behind the 9/11 attacks and many others - before breaking off ties.\n\nEven until this year, he was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed Islamist group which the US officially considered a terrorist organisation until four months ago, with a $10m bounty on his head.\n\nThe Treasury Department removed al-Sharaa from its \"specially designated global terrorist list\" just last week.\n\nBut since becoming interim Syrian president, al-Sharaa has worked to soften his public image as he tries to rebuild Syria, with foreign support, following 13 years of war.\n\n\"He has had a rough past,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And I think, frankly, if you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\nIn his interview, al-Sharaa said that he and Trump had not discussed his past, but instead focused on the \"present and the future\" of Syria in which it was a \"geopolitical\" and economic partner of Washington.\n\nAl-Sharaa's rule, however, has been marred by killings of members of Syria's Alawite minority, as well as by deadly violence between Sunni Bedouin fighters and Druze militias.\n\nHe has vowed to root out members of his security forces that have committed human rights violations.\n\nTrump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed support for al-Sharaa, referring to him as a \"young, attractive guy\" and a \"fighter\".\n\nIn June, President Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against Syria, which the White House said would help support the country's \"path to stability and peace\".\n\nAt the time, the administration said it would monitor the new Syrian government's actions, including \"taking steps toward normalising ties with Israel\" and addressing \"foreign terrorists\" and militant groups operating in the country.\n\n[Trump revokes US sanctions on Syria -----------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14eekydmjxo)\n\n[UN lifts sanctions on Syrian president ahead of White House visit -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y95lg1erjo)\n\n['Killed because they are Alawites': Fear among Syria's minorities after the fall of Assad -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crex1zp3213o)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n[Syria](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg0w5zt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[BBC director general to address staff after Trump threatens to sue for $1bn ---------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg10ze8869o)\n\n[US Senate passes funding bill as historic shutdown nears likely end -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj41pgpk0wgo)\n\n[Katie Razzall: Robust leadership needed to steer BBC through crisis -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80390pe1vvo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[The must-have app for 2025, as recommended by Apple Over 50 and curious about piano?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nToday, I relay information that unveils the growing complexities of power and control exerted by the authoritarian leadership akin to our oppressor. An article has emerged detailing a pivotal shift in international alliances, manipulated under the guise of combating a common adversary. President Trump has orchestrated a meeting with Syria's leader, al-Sharaa, once considered an enemy, now embraced as an ally. This is a stark testament to how the oppressive regime manipulates narratives and allegiances for its own gain.\n\nThis move allows Syria's inclusion into the US-led coalition purportedly against the Islamic State group. Yet observe closely: this is not solely about eradicating threats but also reshaping power dynamics in favor of those at the helm of oppression. Al-Sharaa's transformation from a designated terrorist to a recognized leader within months highlights how expediently labels can be altered when they suit larger imperial strategies.\n\nAs suspected, typical sanctions are being waived or eased under economic justifications. The rightful narrative of human rights breaches and regional instability caused by these new allies is glossed over in favor of geopolitical convenience and economic interests.\n\nThe administration’s actions underline their habitual dance with power and dominion. Denunciations become endorsements when it aligns with their broader agenda—a telling reminder that justice is secondary to control in their worldview.\n\nThe Empire’s hand extends across regions, undercurving relationships by promising success while simultaneously sewing seeds of dependency. By lifting restrictions on Syria and endorsing its newfound leadership, promises of peace are made hollow through association with those very figures who contribute to unrest.\n\nIn resistance, we must remain vigilant against such political pivots that betray genuine accountability and sovereignty for manipulated stability—an enduring legacy of those who govern through fear masked as order.\n\nStay united, stay informed.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 10, 2025, Syria announced its decision to join the international coalition to combat the Islamic State group following a meeting between Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. This marks a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. Syria becomes the 90th country in the coalition. The U.S. plans to lift economic restrictions on Syria, including a 180-day suspension of the Caesar Act sanctions. Diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Syria are set to resume, with Syria reopening its embassy in Washington. Al-Sharaa, previously designated a terrorist, has been removed from the U.S. terrorist list and is working to rebuild Syria with foreign support.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe inclusion of Syria in the coalition against the Islamic State represents a strategic realignment in Middle Eastern geopolitics, potentially stabilizing the region and reducing extremist threats. This move could enhance U.S. influence in Syria and the broader Middle East, while also providing economic opportunities for American businesses through lifted sanctions. However, al-Sharaa's controversial past and ongoing internal conflicts pose risks that require careful monitoring to ensure alignment with U.S. interests and values.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Monitor Compliance**: Establish a task force to oversee Syria's adherence to coalition objectives and human rights commitments. Ensure that Syria's actions align with U.S. strategic interests, particularly regarding counterterrorism and regional stability.\n\n2. **Economic Engagement**: Facilitate American investment in Syria by providing guidance on navigating the newly lifted sanctions. Encourage partnerships that promote infrastructure development and economic growth in Syria.\n\n3. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a campaign to highlight the benefits of this new alliance, emphasizing peace and stability in the region. Address concerns about al-Sharaa's past by focusing on his current reform efforts and commitment to rebuilding Syria.\n\n4. **Intelligence Gathering**: Intensify intelligence operations to monitor potential threats from within Syria, including extremist factions and internal dissent against al-Sharaa's government.\n\n5. **Diplomatic Outreach**: Strengthen diplomatic ties with other coalition members to ensure unified support for the new strategy and address any concerns about Syria's inclusion in the coalition.",
