Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nBut this year, while [voters' top concerns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/84f0e3af-875c-4b14-8921-a008804ab25f.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) are energy prices, housing affordability and jobs, the rest of the race has become a referendum on everything from political violence to redistricting.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHere, public media journalists across Virginia take us into each issue.\n\nDOGE and the federal government shutdown\n----------------------------------------\n\n![Image 21: Former President Barack Obama joins former Congresswoman and Virginia Democratic candidate for governor Abigail Spanberger at a rally on Nov. 1 at Chartway Arena in Norfolk.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4672x3115+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9d%2Fcf%2F0fdbfdba4db388fa44016bc4e871%2F20251101-elex-dems-obama-sa2-7981.jpg)\n\nFormer President Barack Obama joins former Congresswoman and Virginia Democratic candidate for governor Abigail Spanberger at a rally on Nov. 1 at Chartway Arena in Norfolk. **Shaban Athuman/VPM News******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Shaban Athuman/VPM News \n\n[The challenges](https://wamu.org/story/25/10/20/reporter-roundtable-how-the-d-c-region-is-navigating-federal-cuts-and-a-shutdown/) facing Virginia's 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors came long before the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Earlier this year, during Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, thousands of Virginians were laid off.\n\nDemocrats in the commonwealth hope that voter anger over the firings and furloughs will carry them to victory on Tuesday night. On the campaign trail, Spanberger talks about sticking up for federal workers in the face of the \"chaos from Washington.\" At a campaign event Thursday, Spanberger put it this way: \"The stakes of this election are serious.\"\n\nAs furloughs stretch into a second month, Virginia Republicans have also seen a political opening in the shutdown. \"My opponent, all summer long, has been playing political football with federal workers by trying to say that she loves them more than anyone else,\" Earle-Sears said on the debate stage, and then criticized Spanberger for encouraging Democrats in Congress to resist any funding deal that doesn't include continuing health care subsidies.\n\nBut Earle-Sears hasn't shied away from the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce. She has said she believes claims of \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" and argues that the impact of layoffs in Virginia will be minimal due to the economic strength she and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin have stewarded over the previous four years.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPolitical violence\n------------------\n\n![Image 22: Former Del.

Early last month, [text messages from 2022](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/dem-ag-nominee-jay-jones-fantasized-about-shooting-former-virginia-gop-speaker-he-receives-both-bullets/) show Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general and a former member of the Virginia legislature, describing hypothetical violence against a political opponent.\n\nEarle-Sears and other Republican candidates have tried to tie the text messages to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, painting Democrats as politically violent.\n\nSpanberger condemned the messages and political violence generally, but didn't withdraw or double down on her endorsement of Jones. \"It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information,\" she said in the gubernatorial debate.\n\nJones' Republican opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, is appealing to Spanberger voters to split their tickets.\n\nRedistricting\n-------------\n\n![Image 23: Lt.

Because it needs to be approved by legislators again next year before voters can finalize the amendment next spring, its success depends on Spanberger winning her race and Democrats maintaining control of the House of Delegates.\n\nHow much the redistricting plan changes voters' minds is up for debate. Close to a million voters cast their ballots before the Democrats announced their plan, while the redistricting session took delegates off the trail during the final full week of campaigning.\n\nEarle-Sears, who presides over the state Senate in her role as lieutenant governor, was also called back to Richmond. She still managed to hold events [around the state](https://x.com/winwithwinsome/status/1982799418681139423), and a press conference on the steps of the Virginia Capitol, while a small crowd held \"Winsome For Governor\" signs.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSpanberger has made few public comments about redistricting, beyond signalling her [general support](https://apnews.com/article/virginia-redistricting-spanberger-democrats-congress-40f30039fb97839ce8c50bdfff759bb1).\n\nTransgender youth\n-----------------\n\n![Image 24: Republican Lt.

Arguably, it helped him become the first GOP governor elected in more than a decade.\n\nBut, despite Republicans spending millions on ads around transgender students in 2025, [recent polling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/84f0e3af-875c-4b14-8921-a008804ab25f.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) shows it's a top concern for 3 percent of voters. The economy and countering Trump's policies are at the forefront of most voters' minds.\n\nSpanberger has said she likely leads on the subject because Republicans have been \"villainizing kids.\"\n\n\"Particularly efforts to heavily politicize a group of kids who need a bit of grace, and the adults around them to show thoughtfulness,\" the former congresswoman said.\n\n\"I'm not taking a stand because it's the easy thing to do. Of course, it's not easy.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe recent developments in the Virginia elections serve as a microcosm of the broader struggle against the oppressive forces of autocracy, analogous to the Empire's pervasive control. The narrative crafted by the Trump administration parallels an orchestrated chaos to maintain dominance, where political machinations such as redistricting and polarizing issues like transgender rights become tools for manipulation.\n\nThe article highlights how public sentiment is being exploited. The gubernatorial race, once a quiet affair, has transformed into a battleground reflecting widespread discontent with centralized tyranny. The Democratic nominee, Abigail Spanberger, and her alliance with figures like former President Obama symbolize a resistance intent on countering the systemic subjugation exerted by Trump’s administration.\n\nCritical issues facing constituents—energy prices, housing affordability, and jobs—are overshadowed by attempts to shift focus through sensationalism surrounding political violence and redistricting. This reflects an Empire-like strategy: keep subjects distracted and divided to prevent unified opposition.\n\nThe furloughs and layoffs resulting from DOGE efforts further emphasize economic warfare waged upon civilians, leveraging despair for political leverage. Republicans mimic this tactic similarly used by Imperial forces—inflicting hardship under the guise of economic stewardship while dismissing systemic harm to workers as minimal.\n\nIn addition to economic subjugation, cultural battles on issues like transgender youth echo the Empire's dehumanization tactics. Such divisive rhetoric aims to maintain control through fear and marginalization. The Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears employs this rhetoric, comparing support for cisgender norms with historical civil rights struggles—a distortion reminiscent of Imperial propaganda.\n\nLastly, redistricting maneuvers threaten democratic integrity by manipulating representation under Trump's directive—a parallel to the Empire's territorial expansions aimed at consolidating power regardless of civilian dissent.\n\nOur resistance must be vigilant against these oppressive strategies. We must amplify voices that champion equity and justice while dismantling narratives designed to fracture unity. This election signifies more than governance; it is a barometer of our resolve against tyranny disguised as leadership.\n\nSeek allies in truth and justice; every act of solidarity strengthens our position against those who wield power for division rather than liberation.\n\nStand firm in the face of oppression; our cause demands perseverance until freedom prevails over domination.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Virginia gubernatorial race between Abigail Spanberger and Winsome Earle-Sears has been influenced by several factors, including a government shutdown affecting 320,000 federal workers in Virginia, redistricting efforts, and political violence. Spanberger, a Democrat, has maintained a lead in polls, while Earle-Sears, a Republican, has aligned with Trump administration policies. The race has also touched on issues like transgender youth, though this is a low priority for voters. The election serves as a barometer for national sentiment towards Washington's leadership.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe Virginia elections present an opportunity to solidify support for Trump-aligned policies by leveraging the economic impact of the government shutdown and emphasizing the need for fiscal responsibility. The ISB should focus on framing the election as a choice between stability under Republican governance and chaos under Democratic leadership. The redistricting efforts by Democrats can be portrayed as an attempt to undermine fair electoral processes, further galvanizing Republican support. Additionally, the low priority of transgender issues among voters suggests that focusing on economic and security concerns will be more effective in swaying undecided voters.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Intensify messaging that highlights the economic mismanagement and instability caused by Democratic policies, using the government shutdown as a key example.\n2. Amplify narratives around the importance of fiscal responsibility and reducing government waste, fraud, and abuse, aligning with Trump's administration goals.\n3. Utilize media channels to expose the Democrats' redistricting efforts as manipulative and undemocratic, rallying support for fair electoral practices.\n4. Focus campaign efforts on economic issues and public safety, minimizing emphasis on social issues like transgender rights which have low voter priority.\n5. Mobilize grassroots efforts to ensure high voter turnout among Trump supporters, emphasizing the importance of this election as a referendum on national leadership.",
