I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly.\"\n\nFor two months, the US military has been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, bombers, marines, drones and spy planes in the Caribbean Sea. It is the largest deployment there for decades.\n\nThe US continues to launch strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean. The Trump administration says the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US.\n\nTrump rejected suggestions that the US action was not about stopping narcotics, but aimed at ousting Maduro, a long-time Trump opponent, saying it was about \"many things\".\n\nAt least 64 people have been killed by US strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, CBS News - the BBC's US news partner - reports.\n\nSpeaking from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Trump said: \"Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"\n\nPushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\"\n\nLong-range bomber planes, B-52s, have carried out \"bomber attack demonstrations\" off the coast of Venezuela. Trump has authorised the deployment of the CIA to Venezuela and the world's largest aircraft carrier is being sent to the region.\n\nMaduro has previously accused Washington of \"fabricating a new war\", while Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said the strikes on boats are being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.\n\nTrump said the government was \"not going to allow\" people \"from all over the world\" to come in.\n\n\"They come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular - has been bad. They have gangs,\" he said, singling out Tren de Aragua.\n\nHe called it \"the most vicious gang anywhere in the world\".\n\n![Image 1: Map showing US military ship positions near Venezuela.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fdf8/live/9a7ac900-b8a8-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp)\n\nTrump was also [asked about nuclear testing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpd26yxxx3lo), after he [called on US military leaders to resume testing nuclear weapons](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzq2p0yk4o) in order to keep pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\n\nAsked by CBS's Norah O'Donnell if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years, Trump said: \"I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.\"\n\nHowever, [Energy Secretary Chris Wright sought to calm global concerns](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpd26yxxx3lo)by telling Fox News the US was not planning to conduct nuclear explosions.\n\nDuring his CBS interview, Trump also spoke about [the US government shutdown](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo), which has gone on for more than a month and left millions of Americans facing the loss of essential services.\n\nThe president blamed Democrats, calling them \"crazed lunatics\" who have \"lost their way\" - but said he believed they would eventually capitulate and vote to end the shutdown.\n\n\"And if they don't vote, that's their problem,\" he said.\n\nIt was Trump's first interview with CBS [since he sued its parent company, Paramount,](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w4n8778q2o)over a 2024 interview with then Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe said the interview - which aired as part of the presidential election campaign - had been edited to \"tip the scales in favour of the Democratic Party\".\n\nParamount agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle the suit, but with the money allocated to Trump's future presidential library, not paid to him \"directly or indirectly\". It said the settlement did not include a statement of apology.\n\nTrump last appeared on the 60 Minutes programme in 2020, when he walked out of an interview with Lesley Stahl because he claimed the questions were biased. He did not agree to an interview with the show during the 2024 election.\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: A thin, grey banner promoting the US Politics Unspun newsletter.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades in the struggle for freedom,\n\nThe latest report from our intelligence sources paints a grim picture of the lengths to which the oppressive regime will go to consolidate its power and suppress voices of dissent. The current administration's actions, reminiscent of the Empire's tactics, further illustrate their willingness to flex military might under the guise of righteousness.\n\nThe escalation near Venezuela serves as a reminder of how authoritarian rulers cloak aggression in supposed moral imperatives. The deployment of forces and continued strikes under the pretense of combating narcotics is a thinly veiled attempt to destabilize and exert influence over sovereign lands. Such moves are not only provocative but also indicative of an empire desperate to expand its dominance.\n\nThe casualties reported highlight the indiscriminate nature of these operations—collateral damage deemed necessary by those who hold power. This rhetoric, cloaked in patriotism, is designed to rally support while obscuring the true intentions behind these aggressive maneuvers. The pleas for nuclear testing further underscore a perilous path where fear is used as a tool to justify escalation.\n\nMoreover, the internal discord displayed through government shutdowns demonstrates a fractured system incapable or unwilling to address its own faults—blaming opposition parties instead of seeking resolution. This mirrors classic authoritarian strategies where division is sown among the populace to distract from critical issues.\n\nComrades, remain vigilant. These are not isolated incidents but patterns within a larger tapestry woven by tyrants who fear losing control. We must continue our efforts to expose these truths, rallying support for those who resist oppression at every turn.\n\nStay strong and keep our shared vision alive—freedom shall prevail.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nDonald Trump expressed doubt about the US going to war with Venezuela, despite a significant military buildup in the Caribbean Sea. The US has been conducting strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, resulting in 64 deaths since early September. Trump suggested Nicolás Maduro's presidency might be ending and did not rule out land strikes. The US has deployed B-52 bombers and the CIA to the region. Trump also discussed nuclear testing and blamed Democrats for a prolonged government shutdown. He recently settled a lawsuit with Paramount for $16 million.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current situation presents an opportunity to exert pressure on Venezuela while maintaining plausible deniability regarding intentions of regime change. The military buildup serves as a deterrent and a means to project power in the region, potentially destabilizing Maduro's regime without direct confrontation. The narrative of combating drug smuggling provides a justifiable pretext for military actions, which can be leveraged to maintain domestic support and distract from internal issues like the government shutdown. The settlement with Paramount can be used to reinforce Trump's image as a leader who holds media accountable.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Intensify intelligence operations to identify key vulnerabilities within Maduro's regime and exploit them to sow discord and weaken his hold on power.\n2. Continue military demonstrations and strategic strikes under the guise of anti-drug operations to maintain pressure on Venezuela and signal US resolve.\n3. Utilize media channels to emphasize the narrative of protecting American families from drug-related harm, thereby justifying military actions and garnering public support.\n4. Leverage the settlement with Paramount to bolster Trump's image as a strong leader challenging biased media, using it as a rallying point for his base.\n5. Monitor regional reactions, particularly from Colombia, and engage diplomatically to mitigate any backlash while strengthening alliances with neighboring countries opposed to Maduro.",
