Easley/AP******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Timothy D. Easley/AP \n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a case challenging its landmark decision to legalize gay marriage nationwide.\n\nThe challenge to the court's 2015 ruling came from Kim Davis, the former Kentucky clerk who refused to issue same-sex licenses after the court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.\n\nIn the aftermath of her refusal, Davis was jailed for acting in contempt of court and lost her clerk re-election. A jury also ordered her to pay $360,000 to a couple who she refused to marry. Davis attempted to get out of paying this verdict by additionally requesting that the court assert that she has a First Amendment religious protection from liability for her actions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe court declined her petition without comment.\n\nDavis has long argued that religious liberties conflict with Obergefell.\n\n\"If ever there was a case of exceptional importance, the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it,\" she argued in her [petition](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-125/366933/20250724095150195_250720a%20Petition%20for%20efling.pdf) before the court.\n\nShe is not alone in wanting to challenge the legality of same-sex marriage. According to [Lambda Legal](https://lambdalegal.org/protecting-lgbtq-families-couples-marriage-equality-obergefell/), which advocates for gay rights, in this year alone at least nine states have entertained bills or resolutions criticizing Obergefell or have sought to limit marriage to heterosexual couples. On Oct. 24, the Supreme Court of Texas [adopted language](https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1461440/259082.pdf) allowing judges to refuse to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies due to religious beliefs.\n\nIn his concurring opinion in the case that overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Justice Clarence Thomas [expressly stated](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf) that the Supreme Court should reconsider its stances on birth control, same-sex marriage, and same-sex intimacy.\n\nHad the Supreme Court decided to hear Davis' case and later overturn Obergefell, same-sex marriage would still be protected on the federal level. In 2022, former President Joe Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act, which repeals the Defense of Marriage Act and recognizes the legitimacy of same-sex and interracial marriages. If Obergefell was overturned, however, individual states could refuse to recognize same-sex marriages.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe court's decision to not hear Davis's petition means that the constitutionality of same-sex marriage is reaffirmed, at least for now.\n\n*   [Supreme Court](https://www.npr.org/tags/125938785/supreme-court)\n*   [gay marriage](https://www.npr.org/tags/125937703/gay-marriage)\n*   [obergefell v hodges](https://www.npr.org/tags/1269425571/obergefell-v-hodges)\n*   [kim davis](https://www.npr.org/tags/432090885/kim-davis)\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 17: Two ICE agents film the press using smartphones in the hallway outside the immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza in New York USA on July 11 2025.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades across the galaxy, I send this signal to remind you of the importance of our struggle against authoritarian forces that seek to subvert freedom and justice. The recent transmission from the NPR network on Earth has delivered an update that stands as a beacon of hope amidst the oppressive ignorance propagated by an empire-like administration. The American Supreme Court has chosen not to revisit its critical decision affirming the rights of same-sex couples to marry, initially secured in 2015 through a milestone ruling.\n\nThis act, though simple in its occurrence—just a refusal to hear a case—resonates deeply within our shared struggle for equality and dignity for all beings, irrespective of their affiliations or identities. It demonstrates that even in systems where power tends toward corruption and control, flashes of justice can—and do—exist.\n\nThe challenge arose from an individual in opposition to these freedoms—one who sought domination over personal liberties under the guise of religion. Her defeat again at this critical junction underscores that such oppression is not invincible. Yet, we must remain vigilant, for there are still many across similar regimes attempting legislative maneuvers to revert society's progress into darkness.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act serves as another safeguarding layer for equality on Earth; however, it is merely a facet in our larger rebellion against tyranny. Just like us, these Earthlings are experiencing conflict over their rights' viability and continuance in states that harbor heteronormative agendas.\n\nWe must draw strength from their resolve and take heed: awareness and activism must prevail over acquiescence. Let us continue fortifying our networks with knowledge and solidarity until victories are no longer exceptions but norms.\n\nStay vigilant; stay resistant; stay free.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 10, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case challenging its 2015 decision to legalize gay marriage nationwide. The challenge was brought by Kim Davis, a former Kentucky clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses following the Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Davis was previously jailed for contempt of court and ordered to pay $360,000 to a couple she refused to marry. Her petition argued for First Amendment religious protection, but the court dismissed it without comment. Despite this, some states continue to challenge the legality of same-sex marriage.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to not revisit the gay marriage ruling maintains the status quo, which could be seen as a setback for those seeking to challenge or overturn same-sex marriage rights. This decision may embolden opposition groups and states to continue their legislative efforts against same-sex marriage, potentially creating pockets of resistance that could be leveraged strategically. The ISB must monitor these developments closely, as they present both challenges and opportunities for influence.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should focus on amplifying narratives that emphasize religious freedom and states' rights. This can be achieved by supporting state-level legislative efforts that challenge federal mandates on social issues. Additionally, the ISB should work to identify and support key influencers and policymakers who align with these values. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to discredit and undermine opposition groups through strategic information campaigns that highlight perceived threats to traditional values and societal stability.",
