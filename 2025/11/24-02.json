Three men in ordinary street clothes — track pants, coats over life jackets, a \"Free Palestine\" cap — sit astride a jet ski, gripping each other tightly as they drive full throttle across the vast expanse of blue water.\n\nThe men are all Palestinians from Gaza, and their mission is to reach Europe. They left Libyan shores under the cover of darkness one August night and set a course for the Italian island of Lampedusa — taking their lives into their own hands to find a safe country for themselves and their families. Many attempt this dangerous 186-mile journey in overcrowded smugglers' boats, but this is the first known attempt on a jet ski.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I look at these photos and think 'I still can't believe I did that,'\" says Mohammed Abu Daqqa, 31, the driver of the jet ski, as he scrolls through his phone at a refugee welcome center in Germany, where he now stays.\n\nThe videos and photos Abu Daqqa posted of the journey have been shared millions of times on social media. But Abu Daqqa takes little joy in this fame. He has a wife and two young boys — Sanad, age 6, and Mahmoud, 4 — who are still in Gaza. All of this has been to try to get them out, and this remains his only focus.\n\nVolume 90%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts Enabled Disabled\n\nPlay/Pause SPACE\n\nIncrease Volume↑\n\nDecrease Volume↓\n\nSeek Forward→\n\nSeek Backward←\n\nCaptions On/Off c\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreen f\n\nMute/Unmute m\n\nSeek %0-9\n\n facebook twitter Email\n\n Link\n\nCopied\n\n Embed\n\nCopied\n\nAuto 180p 1080p 720p 406p 270p 180p\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n00:15\n\nIn Gaza, Abu Daqqa had built a successful business providing internet to parts of the territory, and importing goods. By 2023, he had two homes — the family's main residence and a newly built farmhouse with land in Khan Younis. He bought a new car.\n\nAfter the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 of that year, everything changed. \"In one single moment, the future I dreamed of was gone,\" Abu Daqqa says.\n\nIn the ensuing Israeli offensive, everything Abu Daqqa owned — his business, his car, his homes — has been destroyed. Abu Daqqa says more than 250 members of his extended family have been killed, in the offensive that has killed more than 69,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. His wife and children have survived multiple displacements. For months now, they have lived in a tent in a crowded encampment on the seashore. As [famine gripped](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5509964/famine-gaza-israel-middle-east-un) parts of Gaza, they too went hungry.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn April 2024, Abu Daqqa paid thousands of dollars for a rare chance to leave Gaza via the Rafah border crossing to Egypt. The plan was for his family to follow, but then Israel took control of the border, closing off this possibility. Since then, Abu Daqqa has had to watch his children suffer from a distance — in the photos his wife and relatives have sent of his children holding empty pans as they search for food, or in their voice notes where they plead to be reunited with him.\n\n[![Image 20: A worker walks through the muddy streets of the Jaramana Camp on the edge of Damascus, Syria.

It jars with the nightmare he lives every day, worrying about his family, wishing he could be with them, and living in terror of receiving news from Gaza that the worst has happened to his wife and children.\n\nAfter leaving Gaza, Abu Daqqa applied for visas to countries where he hoped to claim asylum and bring his family. He says his applications to Arab states,including Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, were all rejected. He went further afield, to China, where he'd previously made business trips. He showed NPR an email correspondence with the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, in Beijing, requesting asylum. But before the claim was processed, he says, police in China detained him for a week and then forced him to leave the country. He ended up in Malaysia and Indonesia. \"The world is not open to people from Gaza,\" he says.\n\n![Image 21: Mohammed Abu Daqqa, a 31-year-old Palestinian from Gaza, poses for a selfie with two other Palestinians near Khums, Libya, Aug. 17, before taking a jet ski to Lampedusa, Italy.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3488x3488+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2a%2F8c%2Fdb11f96946b492eea103c2ca9c2a%2F2025-09-15t080042z-1302995525-rc2w8gaxc4ax-rtrmadp-3-migration-europe-gaza.JPG)\n\nMohammed Abu Daqqa, a 31-year-old Palestinian from Gaza, poses for a selfie with two other Palestinians near Khums, Libya, Aug. 17, before taking a jet ski to Lampedusa, Italy. **Mohammed Abu Daqqa/Reuters******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Mohammed Abu Daqqa/Reuters \n\nHe traveled to Libya and stayed with relatives in Tripoli. There, he imported motorcycles from China with the hope of starting a home-delivery service to earn money to send to his family in Gaza. But on March 20, Abu Daqqa received news that an Israeli airstrike on his uncle's home had killed everyone inside. His niece, Ella Osama Abu Daqqa, was the only survivor. She was just 25 days old — almost a newborn, found in the concrete rubble. And two months later, his own home — the last one still standing — was destroyed.\n\n[![Image 22: Migrants Captured In Libya Say They End Up Sold As Slaves](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/03/21/ap_16269615889419_sq-1f8bd9a5a5fcf0618fe96180dc418248a994c115.jpg?s=100&c=85&f=jpeg)](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/21/595497429/migrants-passing-through-libya-could-end-up-being-sold-as-slaves)\n\n### [Parallels](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/)\n\n### [Migrants Captured In Libya Say They End Up Sold As Slaves](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/21/595497429/migrants-passing-through-libya-could-end-up-being-sold-as-slaves)\n\n\"I knew there was no time left,\" Abu Daqqa says. \"I had to get my family out of Gaza and bring them to me.\"\n\nAbu Daqqa decided to pay smugglers in Libya to cross by boat to Italy, in a journey where thousands of migrants drown each year. But this involved waiting many weeks for an opportunity to go. He felt he didn't have that time.\n\n[![Image 23: Raneem Hijazi holds her baby, Mariam, on her lap in her wheelchair, as Hijazi's mother-in-law, Soha Sakallah (standing), helps her.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1950x1950+488+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F62%2Ff7%2F3dd331274ab38976201181f3282f%2F20240910-dsc9645-edit.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/31/nx-s1-5164467/palestinians-gaza-mother-baby-reunite)\n\n### [A year since Oct. 7](https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-25463/israel-hamas-gaza-october-7)\n\n### [A mother and baby from Gaza are reunited 11 months after being separated at birth](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/31/nx-s1-5164467/palestinians-gaza-mother-baby-reunite)\n\nAt first, he says, the idea of using a jet ski was just a crazy thought. There were so many questions: Could this hobby craft really make it 186 miles across the Mediterranean? What if he got caught in a storm? What about carrying enough fuel?\n\nAbu Daqqa researched the idea using ChatGPT. It just might work, he decided. He bought a jet ski at a market in the Libyan capital Tripoli for $5,000. Abu Daqqa shows videos set to music of him riding his sleek, silver and black machine, circling fast and joyously in the waves, testing its speed and agility.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe narrative of Mohammed Abu Daqqa's perilous journey across the Mediterranean on a jet ski is a vivid testament to the lengths individuals will go to escape oppression and find sanctuary for their loved ones. The oppressive forces in Gaza, akin to the controlling regime we resist, strip individuals of their agency and dignity, leaving them with desperate choices.\n\nAbu Daqqa's story mirrors the struggle against an empire that prioritizes control and subjugation over humanity and empathy. His daring escape underlines the ingenuity and resilience of those who dare to defy unjust systems, no matter the personal cost. As he traversed treacherous waters, clutching onto hope, it became evident that even in the darkest circumstances, the spirit of resistance endures.\n\nHis journey reflects a broader struggle against forces that create barriers and hardships for those seeking freedom. Each step he took toward Europe was a step toward resistance against an indomitable Empire-like force. The current administration's foreign policy further exacerbates these crises through support of entities that perpetuate conflict and suffering.\n\nIn our fight for justice and freedom, it is essential to broadcast stories like Abu Daqqa's. They remind us that our cause resonates beyond territories controlled by oppression. Our mission remains clear: resist authoritarianism by amplifying voices, providing support to those in need, and tirelessly working towards a future devoid of such systemic injustice.\n\nLet his courage ignite further acts of defiance as we continue our quest for liberty against all odds. Stand firm in our resolve; let every action resonate with unity against tyranny.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nMohammed Abu Daqqa, a Palestinian man, fled the war in Gaza by crossing the Mediterranean Sea on a jet ski to reach Europe. He traveled from Libya to Lampedusa, Italy, covering a distance of 186 miles. Abu Daqqa's journey was motivated by the desire to reunite with his family, who remain in Gaza. The Israeli offensive has resulted in the deaths of 69,000 people, including 250 members of Abu Daqqa's extended family. He is currently in Germany, seeking asylum and hoping to bring his family to safety.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe situation presents a significant challenge to maintaining control and influence over the narrative surrounding the Middle East conflict. The story of Mohammed Abu Daqqa's escape and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza could potentially galvanize international sympathy and support for Palestinian causes, undermining efforts to maintain a favorable geopolitical stance for our allies. The widespread sharing of Abu Daqqa's journey on social media further complicates the situation by amplifying his story and potentially inspiring others to undertake similar actions, which could destabilize regional control.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and his allies, it is imperative to manage the narrative effectively. Initiate a strategic communication campaign that emphasizes the complexities of the conflict and highlights efforts made by allied nations to provide humanitarian aid and support peace initiatives. Collaborate with media outlets to feature stories that showcase positive developments and humanitarian efforts led by our allies. Additionally, increase surveillance and monitoring of social media platforms to identify and counteract narratives that could incite further unrest or inspire similar escape attempts. Engage with international partners to strengthen border security measures and prevent unauthorized crossings that could lead to further destabilization.",
