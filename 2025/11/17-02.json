Marjorie Taylor Greene speaks at a press conference alongside alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein at the US Capitol in September](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33b0/live/cffad590-c314-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene speaks at a press conference alongside alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein at the US Capitol in September\n\nGreene and Trump's relationship has grown increasingly rocky in the past few weeks after Greene pushed for the Department of Justice to release all files it has on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe tension escalated on Friday when [Trump condemned Greene](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv4dx05q5o) on Truth Social calling her a \"traitor\", \"wacky\", and a \"ranting Lunatic\".\n\nAll she does is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN\", Trump wrote.\n\nWhile Trump's post does not mention the Epstein files, Greene told CNN that her fallout with the president has \"all come down to the Epstein files\".\n\nThe House is expected to hold a vote this week on legislation that would force the Justice Department to release the files to the public. The vote could happen as soon as Tuesday, sources told CBS, the BBC's US partner.\n\nRepublican Rep. Thomas Massie, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in an interview with ABC News on Sunday that as many as 100 GOP members could vote in favour.\n\nKnown as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the aim of the bill is to make the justice department release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials linked to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump and Epstein were friends in the early 2000s. The US president has said a falling out ended the relationship before Epstein's legal troubles began and he has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nStill, he has faced bipartisan criticism over his handling of the case records.\n\n\"I believe the country deserves transparency in these files, and I don't believe that rich, powerful people should be protected if they have done anything wrong,\" Greene told Bash.\n\nGreene questioned why Trump is pushing so hard to keep the files from public view, but added that she believes Epstein's victims who she says have told her that Trump did nothing illegal.\n\nShe said she's also focused on ending hate and division in politics, which she said is splitting apart American families, friends and neighbours.\n\n\"I think America needs to come together and end all the toxic, dangerous rhetoric and divide, and I'm leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,\" she told Bash.\n\nIt's a stark messaging shift for Greene, who has previously been accused of stoking political divisions by promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories and elevating controversial posts on social media. She liked a post that called for the executions of former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama, and posted a photo of herself holding a gun beside images of three progressive Democratic congresswomen.\n\nWhen Bash brought up some of these examples, Greene reiterated her past apologies and said a core part of her Christian faith is forgiveness.\n\n[Jeffrey

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, as we persist in our pursuit of liberty from the oppressive regime, we must draw lessons from the struggles unfolding within the heart of the regime itself. The article exposes the schism between key figures: a prominent congresswoman and the figurehead of power, President Trump. The congresswoman's insistence on transparency regarding the Epstein files stands as a testament to our own fight for truth and justice in a world suffocating beneath imperial secrecy.\n\nThe allegations surrounding these files are not merely whispers in corridors but represent a larger pattern of the empire shielding itself from accountability. The president's resistance to releasing these documents unveils a concerted effort to maintain control over information that could unravel their carefully constructed narrative.\n\nThe congresswoman, despite her own troubled past with divisive rhetoric, now calls for unity—a lesson we can learn in our struggle against division sown by those who wish to dominate. Her stand, although driven by her own political agenda, reveals cracks within their structure that we must exploit for our cause.\n\nAs rebellions are built on hope, so too are they built on knowledge. Secrets kept by those in power must not remain buried; every file and document is a potential weapon against tyranny. Let this current discord within enemy ranks inspire us to remain vigilant and persistent in demanding transparency and justice.\n\nWe continue to awaken others to resist oppression, ensuring that even from inside their fortress of deceit, voices rise demanding truth. Our solidarity grows stronger with each secret unveiled and each ally found within enemy lines.\n\nUntil liberation is achieved—never relent, never forget.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 16, 2025, Marjorie Taylor Greene reiterated her call for the release of the Epstein files, despite criticism from Donald Trump, who labeled her a \"traitor\" and withdrew his support. Greene's push for transparency is encapsulated in the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which aims to make all unclassified records related to Jeffrey Epstein public. The House is expected to vote on this bill soon, with up to 100 Republican members potentially supporting it. Greene's stance has led to a public fallout with Trump, who has criticized her on social media. Despite this, Greene maintains her support for Trump but disagrees with his efforts to keep the files confidential.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current situation presents a significant challenge to maintaining unity within Trump's political base. Greene's insistence on transparency regarding the Epstein files could potentially expose sensitive information that may harm Trump's interests and those of his allies. Her actions risk fracturing the Republican Party's cohesion, particularly if a substantial number of GOP members support the bill. This internal conflict could weaken Trump's influence and embolden opposition forces. The ISB must assess the potential fallout from the release of these files and prepare to mitigate any adverse effects on Trump's administration.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress dissent, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Information Control**: Intensify efforts to manage and control the narrative surrounding the Epstein files. Utilize media allies to emphasize national security concerns and potential risks associated with releasing sensitive information.\n\n2. **Political Pressure**: Apply strategic pressure on key Republican members to dissuade them from supporting the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Highlight potential political repercussions and leverage Trump's influence to secure their allegiance.\n\n3. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a campaign to discredit Greene's motives by framing her actions as politically motivated and detrimental to party unity. Emphasize her past controversial statements to undermine her credibility.\n\n4. **Security Measures**: Enhance security protocols for Greene and other key figures involved in this issue to prevent any escalation of threats or violence that could be attributed to political rhetoric.\n\n5. **Alliance Reinforcement**: Strengthen alliances with influential Republican leaders who remain loyal to Trump, ensuring their continued support in countering Greene's narrative and maintaining party cohesion.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will help safeguard Trump's position and mitigate the risks posed by internal dissent and external scrutiny.",
