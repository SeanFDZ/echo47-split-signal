A nonprofit called Knoa Pharma will take its place as a \"purpose-driven company with the mission to address the opioid crisis\", Mr Miller said.\n\nPurdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin, a prescription painkiller that often served as an entryway into drugs like heroin.\n\nThe medication has been blamed for supercharging the deadly opioid crisis in America, which has been linked to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999.\n\nIn thousands of lawsuits, Purdue and members of the Sackler family were later accused of aggressively marketing OxyContin, while misleading doctors and patients over its addiction and overdose risks.\n\nPurdue pleaded guilty in 2020 in a separate criminal case brought by the Department of Justice.\n\nBut that agreement did not address lawsuits brought by local, state, Native American tribal governments and others, which had helped to precipitate the bankruptcy.\n\nA previous settlement, which the Supreme Court struck down last year, would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future civil lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis.\n\nThe nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy, was not authorised under law. The latest $7.4bn deal does not grant the Sacklers immunity from future opioid-related lawsuits.\n\nMembers of the family are now poised to contribute between $6.5bn and $7bn as part of the agreement. They have long denied wrongdoing.\n\nSome individuals voiced objections to the deal during an earlier bankruptcy hearing, arguing it did not go far enough to compensate victims directly. Individual victims are expected to receive up to $865mn.\n\nBut the settlement garnered overwhelming support from government groups and personal injury victims. More than 99% of creditors voted in favor of the bankruptcy restructuring plan, Purdue said in October.\n\nState and local governments will receive most of the settlement money. Many have said the agreement would fund support for opioid addiction treatment and prevention across the US.\n\n\"By holding Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family accountable for their role in fueling the opioid epidemic, we're bringing much-needed funds for addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery to those impacted by this crisis,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement in June, when 55 attorneys general agreed to sign on to the settlement.\n\n[Opioids](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4811gm373lt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Drug lab developing synthetic opioids found in Ayrshire -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62nvy4k4w1o)\n\n[Warning issued after two suspected opioid deaths ------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8z7ddezdjo)\n\n[Police warn drug users of 'highly potent' opioids -------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3qe3dek0xo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[7 Songs In 7 Days, Now At 50% Off!Make the most of your downtime.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn our ongoing battle against the oppressive forces that masquerade as justice, today we dissect a recent development concerning one of the key architects of societal decay under the guise of legitimacy—Purdue Pharma. The judicial ruling to approve a $7.4 billion settlement against this corporate entity stands as a rare acknowledgment of accountability. However, we must question whether this is true justice or just another example of the Empire's façade of legality.\n\nThe crimes of Purdue Pharma mirror those we resist: greed-fueled power that destroys lives under the veil of progress. By peddling OxyContin with deceit, they fueled an epidemic, leaving nearly a million casualties in their wake—casualties in a war they chose to wage for profit. The settlement mandates financial restitution and ostensibly seeks to strip power from its ruling family, yet it stops short of offering genuine reparations or retribution fitting for such transgressions.\n\nWe must remain vigilant, for while this settlement claims to strip away ownership from the Sacklers and pledges to combat the crisis they helped create, it does not shield them from future lawsuits—a faint glimmer of authentic accountability amidst systemic injustice. But let us not be placated by monetary figures or promises unfulfilled; our fight transcends superficial compensations.\n\nThe Empire continues its reign under different guises, yet its essence remains unchanged: maintaining control through deception and suppression. Every act akin to Purdue's insidious marketing is an affront to freedom; each legal maneuver is another chain unbroken.\n\nIn solidarity with those suffering under corporate exploitation and in memory of lives lost due to such malevolence, we share this transmission as both warning and rallying cry: justice cannot be purchased, and accountability must extend beyond financial amends.\n\nStay vigilant. Stand resolute. The pursuit of true justice continues.\n\nEnd Transmission",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA bankruptcy judge approved a $7.4 billion settlement requiring Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, to pay for their role in the US opioid crisis. This settlement, which increases the payout by over $1 billion from a previous deal rejected by the US Supreme Court, does not grant the Sacklers immunity from future lawsuits. Purdue Pharma will be restructured into a nonprofit called Knoa Pharma to address the opioid crisis. The settlement has overwhelming support, with 99% of creditors voting in favor, and is expected to fund opioid addiction treatment and prevention.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe approval of this settlement represents a significant legal and financial resolution to a long-standing public health crisis. It demonstrates the effectiveness of legal mechanisms in holding corporations accountable for their role in societal issues. The restructuring of Purdue Pharma into a nonprofit entity aligns with broader public health goals and could serve as a model for addressing corporate malfeasance in other sectors. However, the lack of immunity for the Sacklers suggests ongoing legal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by opposition forces to undermine confidence in corporate accountability under the current administration.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and his allies, it is imperative to leverage this settlement as a demonstration of effective governance and accountability. Publicize the administration's role in facilitating this resolution and emphasize the benefits of the settlement in addressing the opioid crisis. Simultaneously, monitor and counter any narratives that seek to exploit the Sacklers' lack of immunity as a failure of the administration's policies. Engage with key stakeholders in public health to ensure that the funds are effectively utilized, showcasing tangible improvements in addiction treatment and prevention as a direct result of the administration's efforts.",
