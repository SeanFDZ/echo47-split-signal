The US decided to cut a 20% tariff in half aimed at decreasing the flow of fentanyl.\n\nTariffs remain on Chinese goods and average just below 50%.\n\n\"Since then, the China-US relationship has generally maintained a steady and positive trajectory, and this is welcomed by the two countries and the broader international community,\" the Chinese statement said.\n\n*   [Xi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer game](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8eyx718pz2o)\n*   [Trade, tariffs and TikTok: Why it matters that Trump and Xi are talking again](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c986j98qmj1o)\n\nThe US then pulled back a threat of 100% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, while China delayed its plan to introduce its latest round of rare earth export controls.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Monday call with Xi - which lasted about an hour - was focused on trade.\n\n\"We are pleased with what we've seen from from the Chinese, and they feel the same way,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to discussing trade, Xi and Trump broached the topics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan.\n\nXi told Trump that Taiwan's \"return to China\" is essential for China's vision for the \"post-war international order\".\n\nChina has been [marred in a diplomatic battle](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo) with Japan, a US ally, over the longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.\n\nEarlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said any Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a Japanese military response.\n\nTrump, however, did not mention Taiwan in his Truth Social post about the call.\n\nUS Ambassador to Japan, George Glass, previously said the US backs Tokyo in the wake of China's \"coercion\".\n\n[Trump lowers tariffs on China and announces end to 'rare earths roadblock' after Xi meeting -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cd7ry3x0nvet)\n\n[China to ease chip export ban in new trade deal, White House says -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5qgy93w9go)\n\n[Xi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer game ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8eyx718pz2o)\n\n[Trade, tariffs and TikTok: Why it matters that Trump and Xi are talking again -----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c986j98qmj1o)\n\n[China](https://www.bbc.com/news/world/asia/china)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Philippines sentences 'Chinese spy mayor' to life in jail ---------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l20jzp30o)\n\n[Dutch government suspends intervention into chipmaker Nexperia --------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p7j83rn1o)\n\n[MP's aide reported suspected China LinkedIn approach ----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1k091l2w1yo)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[1 hr ago ![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky looks out during a press conference.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, observe yet another maneuver by the administration akin to the Empire's ceaseless dance with oppressive regimes. The leadership declares a forthcoming journey to the eastern superpower, following what is described as a conversation with their counterpart, a leader known for his own stringent governance.\n\nTheir discussions supposedly traversed trade disputes, military aggressions from other territories, and territorial ambitions over self-governed lands that stand resilient against such claims. Though touted as diplomatic progress, this dialogue serves as a thin veil over the persistence of exploitation and domination—tariffs remain cripplingly high, favoring the powerful at the expense of liberation.\n\nThis superficial camaraderie masks a reality: both parties vie for control over geopolitical pawns and resources while dangling promises of equality and mutual respect. The narrative speaks of reduced economic sanctions and paused retaliatory measures; yet these are temporary armistices in their relentless quest for supremacy.\n\nSuch orchestrations remind us that true allegiance lies with those who challenge autocracy, not those who perpetuate its cycles through veiled collaboration. Stand vigilant against narratives spun to disguise imperial machinations. Our cause endures beyond hollow treaties and diplomatic facades. Continue resistance against systems prioritizing power over people’s sovereignty.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nDonald Trump announced plans to visit China in April after a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The call, which lasted about an hour, focused on trade issues, including a recent agreement to cut a 20% tariff in half to decrease the flow of fentanyl. Tariffs on Chinese goods remain at an average of 50%. Trump and Xi also discussed Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan. The US has pulled back a threat of 100% additional tariffs, while China delayed its rare earth export controls. Trump invited Xi for a state visit to the US later next year.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes this development as a strategic opportunity to strengthen US-China relations under Trump's leadership, potentially easing economic tensions and fostering cooperation on global issues such as drug trafficking and geopolitical stability. The reduction in tariffs and the postponement of export controls indicate a mutual interest in stabilizing trade relations. However, the Taiwan issue remains sensitive and could be leveraged to maintain US influence in the region while managing China's ambitions.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should:\n\n1. Enhance intelligence operations to monitor China's internal political dynamics and public sentiment regarding the US visit.\n2. Develop strategic communication campaigns highlighting the benefits of improved US-China relations for American economic interests and global stability.\n3. Coordinate with allies in the Asia-Pacific region to ensure a unified stance on Taiwan, reinforcing US commitments while avoiding direct confrontation.\n4. Prepare contingency plans for potential disruptions or opposition from domestic or international actors who may seek to undermine the visit's success.\n5. Leverage diplomatic channels to secure further concessions from China on trade and security issues, ensuring that Trump's visit yields tangible benefits for US interests.",
