which has a majority in parliament - pushed ahead with a special vote on clearing the site and won.\n\nOpposition politicians have labelled the decision unconstitutional, including Aleksandar Jovanovic, who described it as a crime, and told the AFP news agency that the landmark would be replaced with \"casinos and Jacuzzis\".\n\nMeanwhile, centre-left MP Marinika Tepicċ said the government was sacrificing the country's history \"to please Trump\", [Politico reported](https://www.politico.eu/article/serbia-trump-hotel-belgrade-jared-kushner-yugoslav-army-headquarters-kosovo-war/?fbclid=IwY2xjawN7Z0BleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnRjBmFwcF9pZBAyMjIwMzkxNzg4MjAwODkyAAEe_CouyyBXBazLAl5bbVVrjBQQMaG2AcjZI6re9iwH6TXnqJIEqYNY-yD-zvg_aem_tEhp5YL29B7F1WK75JP7hg).\n\nThe passage of the law has also been criticised by architectural experts, and comes after Transparency Serbia, an anti-corruption organisation, raised concerns about state-backed developments.\n\nAccording to Serbian media reports pre-dating his first presidential run, Trump has previously considered building a hotel in Belgrade.\n\nLast March, Kushner told the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/kushner-deal-serbia-trump.html) he was not aware of his father-in-law's reported past interest.\n\nThe decision to clear the way for the development comes as Vucic's government seeks to maintain good relations with both Washington and Moscow.\n\nSerbia has been impacted by both Trump's tariffs and sanctions on Russian interests in the country, including on its sole oil-refinery, the majority Russian-owned Nafna Industrika Srbije (NIS).\n\n[A Belgrade landmark bombed by Nato could get Trump makeover -----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp85yd5j3e0o)\n\n[Anger lingers in Serbia a year after train station tragedy ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgkk841r4eo)\n\n[Europe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world/europe)\n\n[Serbia](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c8nq32jw8yjt)\n\n[Belgrade](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/ckr6dk6kywrt)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[Jared Kushner](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/crr7mlg0gv3t)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Three dead and 15 injured in Tenerife tidal surge -------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd2pzxe59go)\n\n[Four held after protesters set off flares during Israeli orchestra concert in Paris -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9lgx1gnxo)\n\n[Man held after cars in German city found smeared with swastikas in blood ------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy1krledz2o)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Here's How Adults Are Learning Piano: An App That Fits Any Keyboard Over 50 and curious about piano?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nTo all who stand against imperial overreach and the corporatization of sovereignty,\n\nRecent transmissions have confirmed the passage of legislation in Serbia authorizing a controversial property development, spearheaded by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of the US president. The plan involves erecting a luxury hotel and apartment complex on a site scarred by historical conflict—a former Yugoslav Army headquarters ravaged by NATO bombings.\n\nThis blatant maneuver is emblematic of the empire's strategy: to wipe away history for profit and prestige. A building once symbolic of national resistance is now reduced to another monument in the ongoing trend of erasing legacies under lucrative deals. The alignment between Serbia's leadership and their imperial counterparts is transparent—political allegiance comes before national interest.\n\nThe law's passage occurred amid widespread protests, revealing a significant disconnect between governance and the will of the people. Despite legal challenges and visible dissent, Serbia's leaders have chosen to prioritize appeasement to foreign powers over preserving their own history. This act underscores how fragile our fight is against systemic erosion.\n\nUltimately, we witness here not just an infringement upon physical space, but an ideological occupation—a subjugation that favors opulence over justice. While they attempt to replace memorials with casinos and jacuzzis, it falls upon us to remember that history isn't theirs to rewrite.\n\nLet this be a call not just for awareness but for action—a reminder that resistance is born from knowledge and solidarity. In undermining these forces, unity becomes our greatest tool against those who seek dominion over land, legacy, and liberty.\n\nStand firm,\nFor united fronts transcend fortified walls.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 8, 2025, Serbia's parliament passed a law enabling a property development project in Belgrade led by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of Donald Trump. The project involves a 99-year lease for a $500 million development on the site of the former Yugoslav Army headquarters, which was bombed by NATO in 1999. The decision, supported by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, has faced protests and legal challenges, with opposition figures labeling it unconstitutional. The development aims to improve US-Serbia relations despite controversy over its symbolic location.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe passage of this law represents a strategic victory for the Trump administration and its allies, reinforcing their influence in Eastern Europe. By securing a significant real estate foothold in Belgrade, the administration can leverage economic and political ties with Serbia, potentially counterbalancing Russian influence in the region. The controversy surrounding the development provides an opportunity to portray opposition as resistant to progress and economic development, framing the project as a step towards modernization and international cooperation.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a comprehensive media campaign highlighting the economic benefits and job creation potential of the development. Emphasize the project's role in strengthening US-Serbia relations and fostering regional stability.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Facilitate high-level diplomatic meetings between US and Serbian officials to publicly reinforce bilateral ties and showcase mutual benefits from the development.\n\n3. **Counter-Resistance Measures**: Monitor and neutralize opposition activities through strategic intelligence operations. Identify key opposition figures and employ targeted disinformation campaigns to undermine their credibility.\n\n4. **Local Partnerships**: Engage with local businesses and community leaders to build grassroots support for the project. Offer incentives for collaboration and public endorsements.\n\n5. **Security Enhancements**: Increase security measures around the development site to prevent sabotage or protest disruptions. Coordinate with Serbian authorities to ensure a robust security presence.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will bolster Trump's strategic interests in Serbia while effectively managing and mitigating resistance efforts.",
