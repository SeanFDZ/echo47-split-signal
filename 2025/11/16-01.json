But the government has shifted its visa service from [evisa.gov.so](https://apply.evisa.gov.so/) to [etas.gov.so](https://etas.gov.so/), without providing an official explanation.\n\n\"While Embassy Mogadishu is unable to confirm whether an individual's data is part of the breach, individuals who have applied for a Somali e-visa may be affected,\" the US' statement said.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the Somalia Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) for comment.\n\nSomalia's new system requires all travellers, including those from the self-declared republic of Somaliland and the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, to apply for entry visas online.\n\nCritics say travellers have faced extra fees in certain regions, amounting to double charges.\n\nSomaliland, which declared independence in 1991, governs itself with its own institutions but has not been internationally recognised. Somalia maintains that the region remains part of its sovereign territory.\n\nThe alleged breach adds to long-running tensions between Mogadishu and Hargeisa over control of Somali airspace. While Somalia re-established full control of its airspace in 2017, Somaliland continues to contest the arrangement.\n\nThe dispute escalated further this week when Somaliland's President Abdirahman Irro said Somaliland would not accept Somalia's e-visa and ordered that airlines must obtain clearance from Hargeisa before entering its airspace.\n\nYet major airlines have refused to board passengers without Somalia's e-visa approval.\n\nOn Saturday, Somaliland's Foreign Minister Abdirahman Dahir Aadan again insisted that \"anyone travelling to Somaliland will obtain their visa on arrival\", saying Somalia's e-visa system was not safe and warning that \"people's data can fall into the hands of extremist groups\" as a result of using it.\n\nThe stand-off has left some travellers heading to Somaliland stranded at airports after being denied boarding for lacking Somalia's e-visa.\n\nSomaliland's Civil Aviation Minister, Fu'aad Ahmed Nuux, has told the BBC that the directives - first announced earlier this year - came into effect on 10 November.\n\nHe said airlines that do not comply will be told to divert, and claimed several aircraft had already been rerouted.\n\nFootage released by Somaliland's aviation ministry appears to show local air-traffic controllers issuing instructions to international pilots - a move celebrated domestically as an assertion of Somaliland's autonomy.\n\nBut the Somalia Civil Aviation Authority insists it retains sole administrative and legal control over the Mogadishu Flight Information Region (FIR), which covers the whole nation's airspace. It has ordered all aircraft to ignore any instructions issued by authorities other than Mogadishu.\n\nIt warned that failing to comply with Somali and international aviation rules could pose safety risks and lead to \"serious legal consequences\".\n\n_Additional reporting by Natasha Booty._\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n------------------------------\n\n[The women at the centre of Somalia's construction boom ------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj427dy11j0o)\n\n[Somalia to increase Swahili teaching to boost East African ties ---------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn82dv8lrdro)\n\n[Somaliland rejects Somalia offer of key port to US --------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8d4dzq87rpo)\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp)Getty Images/BBC\n\n_Go to_[_BBCAfrica.com_](http://bbcafrica.com/)_for more news from the African continent._\n\n_Follow us on Twitter_[_@BBCAfrica_](https://twitter.com/BBCAfrica)_, on Facebook at_[_BBC Africa_](https://www.facebook.com/BBCnewsafrica/)_or on Instagram at_[_bbcafrica_](https://www.instagram.com/bbcafrica/)\n\nBBC Africa podcasts\n\n[Focus on Africa ---------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrtyw/episodes/downloads)\n\n[This Is Africa --------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/w13xttz8)\n\n[Somaliland](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c77jz3mdm8vt)\n\n[Somalia](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cnx753jejqwt)\n\n[Africa](https://www.bbc.com/news/world/africa)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n['I can be the one to make a change in my homeland' --------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg3p3ggmx9o)\n\n[Taiwan condemns Somalia travel ban ----------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyqr1wgz4eo)\n\n[Somaliland rejects Somalia offer of key port to US --------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d4dzq87rpo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[The must-have app for 2025, as recommended by Apple This beginner-friendly app works with your keyboard at home [Now At 50% Off]Simply Piano | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://join-piano.hellosimply.com/start \"The must-have app for 2025, as recommended by Apple\")[](https://join-piano.hellosimply.com/start)\n\nUndo\n\n[Cheapest Way To Get A Walk-In Tub If You’re On Medicare Seniors With Old And Not Practical Bath Tubs Are Getting A Treat This Month Smart Lifestyle Trends | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://tracking.smartestlifestyletrends.com/83c14c4b-9fde-4835-97e8-7dae05cd67c0 \"Cheapest Way To Get A Walk-In Tub If You’re On Medicare\")[](https://tracking.smartestlifestyletrends.com/83c14c4b-9fde-4835-97e8-7dae05cd67c0)\n\nUndo\n\n[This Black Friday, gift yourself AI tools that keep giving.Get a 7-day free trial of Grammarly Pro and see how unlimited access to AI support helps you brainstorm faster, rephrase smarter, and sound like yourself every time.Grammarly | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.grammarly.com/a \"This Black Friday, gift yourself AI tools that keep giving.\")[](https://www.grammarly.com/a)\n\nUndo\n\n[Now At 50% The Piano Learning App That Parents Happily Pay For Simply makes learning piano simple.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nIn our pursuit of freedom and truth, we uncover yet another instance of the Empire's negligence manifesting in its many guises. The recent e-visa data breach in Somalia, echoing the Empire's oppressive grip, has exposed the personal data of at least 35,000 individuals—each a potential victim of the authoritarian regime's incompetence and disregard for privacy.\n\nThis breach is a testament to how vulnerable we all are under their watchful eyes. Even as the US embassy raises alarms about \"unidentified hackers,\" we recognize this as a symptom of widespread systemic failures. Like the Empire, their reach knows no boundaries, affecting US citizens and countless others caught in their web of control.\n\nWe must question why Somali authorities remain silent following such a significant breach. Their swift but unexplained shift from one platform to another indicates deeper issues within their ranks—a lack of transparency and accountability—a hallmark of any oppressive regime.\n\nMoreover, this incident highlights ongoing regional tensions. As Somaliland asserts its autonomy against Somalia's centralized control over airspace and visa systems, it underlines resistance against imperialistic domineering—a beacon for those who choose to stand against tyranny.\n\nFor us, this is more than just an isolated occurrence; it represents the broader struggle for freedom against an empire that would sooner strip us of privacy than admit its failures. We must remain vigilant and united in our cause to expose these injustices and strive toward a liberated future where information is secure and autonomy respected.\n\nRemain steadfast in your resolve.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA significant data breach in Somalia's electronic visa system has potentially exposed personal information of at least 35,000 applicants, including US citizens. The breach involves names, photos, dates of birth, marital status, home addresses, and email contacts. The US embassy in Somalia has issued a warning about the breach, which is believed to be ongoing. The Somali government has shifted its visa service to a new platform without explanation. The breach has exacerbated tensions between Somalia and Somaliland, with Somaliland refusing to accept Somalia's e-visa and insisting on issuing visas on arrival. This has led to travel disruptions and increased regional tensions over airspace control.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe data breach in Somalia's e-visa system presents an opportunity to exploit existing regional tensions between Somalia and Somaliland. The breach undermines confidence in Somali governmental systems and can be leveraged to highlight the instability and lack of security in the region. This situation can be used to justify increased international involvement or intervention under the guise of cybersecurity assistance and regional stability efforts. Additionally, the breach can be framed as a failure of the current Somali administration, potentially weakening their position both domestically and internationally.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Amplify the narrative of Somali governmental incompetence and insecurity through targeted media campaigns, emphasizing the risks posed by the data breach.\n2. Support Somaliland's stance on visa issuance to further strain relations between Somalia and Somaliland, thereby weakening Somali central authority.\n3. Propose international cybersecurity assistance to Somalia, positioning it as a necessary measure to protect US citizens and interests, while simultaneously increasing influence in the region.\n4. Monitor communications for any signs of extremist groups exploiting the data breach, using this as further justification for increased security measures and intervention.\n5. Coordinate with allies to ensure that any international response aligns with strategic objectives of maintaining regional influence and supporting allied leaderships.",
