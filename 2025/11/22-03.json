Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs.\n\nBut how many migrants would be affected by Trump's announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.\n\nCongress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.\n\nThe president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was \"a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\"\n\n\"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,\" Trump wrote. \"It's OVER!\"\n\n[![Image 18: A woman poses for a portrait outside her home, Saturday, July 19, 2025, in Tampa.

As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.\n\nThat included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under President Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 19: Fearing deportation, undocumented parents are preparing to leave their kids behind](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2Fa1%2F94566ae64b3480d1c6307f0df214%2F5412bf49-9c65-4d81-abff-c47bd7434642.png)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/22/nx-s1-5616465/fearing-deportation-undocumented-parents-are-preparing-to-leave-their-kids-behind)\n\n##### [Code Switch](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch)\n\n#### [Fearing deportation, undocumented parents are preparing to leave their kids behind](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/22/nx-s1-5616465/fearing-deportation-undocumented-parents-are-preparing-to-leave-their-kids-behind)\n\n[![Image 20: Line drawing of a woman holding a baby looking out a window.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2Ffc%2F0588bda244399c67e8e803a8c970%2F5a80c212-a149-4cb3-a1e8-98685a9acac2.png)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5553426/how-undocumented-families-are-navigating-the-looming-threat-of-ice)\n\n##### [Code Switch](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch)\n\n#### [How undocumented families are navigating the looming threat of ICE](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5553426/how-undocumented-families-are-navigating-the-looming-threat-of-ice)\n\n[![Image 21: Flames and smoke billow from buildings during mass Russian drones and missile strikes on Ukraine's capital in July 2025, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4432x2493+0+562/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa4%2Fa2%2Fe48a125e4fcaae7ce26418f94c21%2Fgettyimages-2222752152.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/g-s1-98262/ukraine-deportations-war)\n\n##### [Immigration](https://www.npr.org/sections/immigration)\n\n#### [U.S. deports dozens of migrants to Ukraine amid war](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/g-s1-98262/ukraine-deportations-war)\n\n[![Image 22: Joseph Edlow (R), now the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director, administers the Oath of Allegiance to twelve candidates for U.S. citizenship during a naturalization ceremony hosted by the USCIS at the State Department in October 2020.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5027x2828+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2Ff1%2F483a0fc4495aa8af954582280111%2Fgettyimages-1229220583.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/g-s1-96806/trump-public-charge-rule)\n\n##### [Immigration](https://www.npr.org/sections/immigration)\n\n#### [Trump administration rule could further penalize immigrants for using benefits](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/g-s1-96806/trump-public-charge-rule)\n\n[![Image 23: Hundreds marched in downtown Chicago on Oct. 8, protesting President's Trump deployment of National Guard troops and the presence of immigration enforcement agents in the city.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5712x3213+0+536/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2Ff5%2Fc2190d69401dbe40d74cdc20dc50%2Fimg-4295.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/17/nx-s1-5611168/doj-records-show-hundreds-of-immigrants-arrested-in-chicago-had-no-criminal-histories)\n\n##### [Immigration](https://www.npr.org/sections/immigration)\n\n#### [DOJ records show hundreds of immigrants arrested in Chicago had no criminal records](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/17/nx-s1-5611168/doj-records-show-hundreds-of-immigrants-arrested-in-chicago-had-no-criminal-histories)\n\n[![Image 24: A woman poses for a portrait outside her home, Saturday, July 19, 2025, in Tampa.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe recent move by the regime to terminate legal protections for Somali migrants in Minnesota mirrors the oppressive tactics we have witnessed throughout history. This termination of Temporary Protective Status (TPS) is more than just a bureaucratic maneuver; it is a calculated strike against vulnerable communities, designed to sow fear and division.\n\nWe must recognize that this act of tyranny targets not only the Somali community but also sets a dangerous precedent for all marginalized groups. These legal protections were established to prevent deportations to countries suffering from civil strife or natural disasters—a humanitarian effort now being dismantled under the guise of national security.\n\nThe regime's narrative of cracking down on fraudulent activities and infiltrating gangs is nothing but a smokescreen to justify their xenophobic agenda. Labeling entire communities as threats only serves to dehumanize them and alienate them from society. We are witnessing an administration attempting to isolate and vilify those they perceive as different or unworthy.\n\nThe statement by the Council on American-Islamic Relations underscores this chilling reality: families will be torn apart, dreams shattered, and lives endangered because of a political playbook driven by hate and Islamophobia. We cannot sit idly by while such discrimination takes root.\n\nAs freedom fighters, it is our duty to stand with those who are oppressed and resist these imperial actions through solidarity and advocacy. Let us amplify the voices of those affected, rallying together against this expansion of autocratic power. The well-being of our allies in Minnesota is a reflection of our shared struggle against injustice everywhere.\n\nStay vigilant, remain united.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 22, 2025, President Donald Trump announced the immediate termination of temporary legal protections for Somali migrants residing in Minnesota. This decision affects approximately 705 individuals covered by the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, which was initially designed to prevent deportations to countries experiencing natural disasters or civil strife. Trump's announcement was made via social media, where he cited concerns about fraudulent activities and gang violence within the Somali community in Minnesota. The move has been criticized by the Council on American-Islamic Relations as a politically motivated attack on the Somali and Muslim communities.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe termination of TPS for Somali migrants aligns with the administration's broader strategy to implement stringent immigration policies and reduce the number of immigrants residing in the United States. By targeting a specific community, the administration aims to reinforce its stance on immigration control and address perceived security threats. This action may serve to consolidate support among Trump's base, who favor stricter immigration measures. However, it risks inciting backlash from human rights organizations and minority communities, potentially leading to increased social tensions and protests.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's directive and mitigate resistance, the ISB should implement a comprehensive communication strategy that emphasizes the administration's commitment to national security and economic stability. This includes disseminating information highlighting the alleged criminal activities within the Somali community and the necessity of terminating TPS to protect American citizens. Additionally, the ISB should monitor and counteract any organized resistance or protests by deploying intelligence resources to identify key agitators and disrupt their activities. Engaging with local law enforcement agencies in Minnesota to ensure compliance and maintain order will be crucial in executing this directive effectively.",
