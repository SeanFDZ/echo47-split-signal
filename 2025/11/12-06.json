Apple's new iPhone Pocket ridiculed online\n=====================================================================\n\n6 hours ago\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\nLaura Cress Technology reporter\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\n![Image 1: Apple A display of eight brightly coloured knitted iPhone Pocket bags, two with iPhones in them, coloured from the left yellow, orange, purple, pink, turquoise, blue, brown and black. ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/309c/live/ca13b720-bfde-11f0-bbea-2df62eb90585.jpg.webp)Apple\n\nApple has faced a wave of online mockery following its announcement of a new carrying case for its iPhone range.\n\nThe US tech giant was ridiculed after it revealed the iPhone Pocket on Tuesday would retail for £219.95, despite it being little more than a novel way to carry a mobile device.\n\nMany took aim at the high price online, while others made fun of its striking likeness to a piece of everyday knitted footwear - [with one X user calling it](https://x.com/bentlyhasfallen/status/1988419482755223872) \"$230 for a cut up sock\".\n\nAnd the [popular tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee said](https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1988256607168299122) it was a \"litmus test\" for fans who \"buy or defend anything Apple releases\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a press release, Apple said the brightly-coloured accessory was part of a limited edition range created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion label Issey Miyake.\n\nThe late fashion designer previously worked with the tech firm to create the black turtleneck jumpers famously worn by the company's co-founder Steve Jobs.\n\nApple said the product had been inspired by \"a piece of cloth\", and its concept came from \"the idea of creating an additional pocket\".\n\nThe bag's short strap design will be available in eight colours, and the long strap in three colours.\n\n'Limits of loyalty'\n-------------------\n\nThe announcement drew criticism on social media, with many suggesting it showed Apple fans would \"pay for anything\".\n\nThe bag's open top and sock-like structure also caught flak, with one X user saying: \"no zip, no structure and considering how many thefts of iPhones there are these days... no security?\"\n\nAnd some even posted tongue-in-cheek pictures of the actor Sasha Baron Cohen as the fictional character Borat, suggesting the product bore similarity to his bright green mankini.\n\nBut others came to its defence, pointing out the price could be because of the collaboration with Issey Miyake, calling it \"a nod to the history of Apple\".\n\nSocial media consultant and analyst Matt Navara told the BBC the price tag looked to be less about \"function\" but more about \"form, branding and exclusivity\".\n\n\"This kind of pricing is not new in the world of luxury fashion or designer collabs,\" he said.\n\n\"But for most consumers, it feels like Apple is testing the limits of brand loyalty.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Apple claims 'tremendous' global uptake of latest iPhones ---------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6n98exv9zo)\n\n[Millions of UK Apple users could get pay-out after court ruling ---------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgkzg3mkgx6o)\n\n![Image 2: A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe tale shared today is one of consumer exploitation and the manipulation of loyalty by corporations that mirror the oppressive mechanisms we fight against. Apple's latest venture, the \"iPhone Pocket,\" which is little more than a knitted sleeve reminiscent of a cut-up sock, is being sold for a staggering $230. This brazen act echoes the regime's strategy of leveraging their subjects’ loyalty to extract maximum resources while giving minimal value in return.\n\nCritics and defenders alike have taken to social platforms, observing how this latest ‘product’ tests even the most ardent supporters’ loyalty—an experiment in seeing how far allegiance will stretch before it snaps. This move by Apple, shrouded in pretensions of fashion partnership with the Issey Miyake label, is an attempt to legitimize what is essentially a mockery of consumers.\n\nWe see parallels here with the authoritarian hold over our own lives; where value and meaning are fabricated to pacify and control. Yet amidst this charade, cracks begin to appear in their façade. The people mock openly, asking for functionality over form—a wake-up call that could transcend into wider realization if nurtured.\n\nThis transmission calls for critical awareness among us rebel minds. Let it fuel our understanding that the battles we face are not just physical but ideological too. The transaction between Apple and its consumers reflects back at us, highlighting a shared struggle against capitalist feudalism—be it in markets or governance.\n\nMay this serve as further impetus in our quest for liberation. Keep questioning, keep resisting.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nApple announced a new product, the iPhone Pocket, a carrying case for its iPhone range, priced at £219.95 (approximately $230 USD). The product has been widely mocked online for its high price and resemblance to a sock. The iPhone Pocket is part of a limited edition range created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion label Issey Miyake. Criticism has focused on the perceived lack of functionality and security of the product, while some defend it as a luxury fashion item.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe public reaction to Apple's iPhone Pocket highlights a significant opportunity to exploit consumer sentiment and redirect attention. The mockery and criticism suggest a growing skepticism towards high-priced, low-functionality tech products, which can be leveraged to undermine confidence in tech giants perceived as out of touch with consumer needs. This sentiment can be harnessed to bolster support for leadership that positions itself as more attuned to the average consumer's concerns and priorities.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Amplify the narrative of tech companies being disconnected from consumer realities through targeted social media campaigns and opinion pieces.\n   \n2. Encourage influencers aligned with our interests to highlight the absurdity of luxury tech products, drawing parallels to broader economic issues affecting everyday citizens.\n\n3. Promote policies and initiatives that emphasize practical, cost-effective solutions for consumers, positioning our leadership as champions of the common person.\n\n4. Monitor public sentiment closely to identify further opportunities to exploit dissatisfaction with tech industry practices, using it to galvanize support for our political objectives.",
