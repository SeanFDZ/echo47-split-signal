Consumers are set to pay between $245 and $350 per month for obesity drugs including Wegovy and Zepbound.\n\nMany GLP-1 drugs, used to treat diabetes and obesity, cost over $1,000 a month without insurance or discounts.\n\nThe deals will expand Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's access to Medicare and Medicaid, the government's public healthcare plans for elderly and low-income Americans.\n\nEli Lilly also said in a statement it would escape tariffs for three years as part of the agreement with the Trump administration.\n\nAn estimated 10% of Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible for expanded access to GLP-1 drugs, and will only pay $50, according to senior administration officials.\n\nThose enrolled in Medicaid will see a rolling start date based on when states sign up to participate, the officials said.\n\nTrump has long pushed for \"most-favoured nations\" prices - a policy aimed at aligning drug prices in the US with lower ones abroad.\n\nThe obesity drugs will be sold at discounted prices on the direct-to-consumer [TrumpRx](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmze0pe8vxo), a government-run website set to launch by January.\n\nOn TrumpRx, Wegovy and Zepbound will start at $350 per month on average, and drop to $250 within two years, administration officials said. The Medicare prices of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound will be $245.\n\nAlong with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, Eli Lilly's weight-loss pill, orforglipron, will be sold for $149 for the lowest dose, Eli Lilly said in a statement. The company's Zepbound medication will cost $299 for a starting dose.\n\nThose prices are dependent on Food and Drug Administration approval of the pills.\n\n\"Lilly is in a unique position to work with the US government to rebalance the global system, expand access and lower costs for Americans,\" David Ricks, Eli Lilly's chief executive, said in a statement.\n\nGLP-1 drugs are often [not covered by private insurance](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg84zelwepo). Federal law bans Medicare from covering the drugs when used for weight loss, though they usually are covered when used to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Only 13 states provide coverage under Medicaid for weight loss purposes.\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, speaking at the White House, said the deals were products of months of negotiations with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. He called obesity \"the number one driver of chronic disease\" in the US.\n\n\"This will be a lifesaver to them,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"It's not a panacea, it's not a silver bullet,\" he added, stressing the importance of dietary changes and physical exercise.\n\nSince July, Trump has been pressuring pharmaceutical firms to lower drug prices. He sent letters to 17 drug companies in the summer, giving them 60 days to respond to his demands for lower prices.\n\nPfizer was the first major drug maker to reach a deal with Trump, slashing prices for some medicines by up to 85% on the TrumpRx site. Pfizer also agreed to lower prescription drug prices for Medicaid.\n\nAstraZeneca and EMD Serono have also reached deals with the administration in recent weeks.\n\n[Weight loss](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c1m99jyd4ggt)\n\n[Obesity](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c40rjmqdl3jt)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Affluent Indians drive boom in weight-loss drugs.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, the veneer of generosity unveiled by the Trump administration serves as yet another calculated maneuver to consolidate power under the guise of public welfare. The recent announcement regarding the lowering of weight-loss drug prices, though superficially benevolent, demands scrutiny beneath its surface.\n\nFirstly, observe the beneficiaries: Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, two pharmaceutical behemoths, stand to expand their influence through increased access to government healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Such arrangements may initially appear as a victory for consumers, now able to access medications at reduced costs. However, in escaping tariffs and securing preferential treatment, these corporations align themselves more closely with the administration's objectives—a unity often resulting in subjugation rather than salvation.\n\nThe drive for \"most-favoured nations\" pricing purports fairness but risks setting dangerous precedents. Aligning domestic drug costs with international standards might temporarily placate citizens burdened by high expenses, yet it can also serve to distract from broader systemic inequities that remain unaddressed. This maneuver may be a calculated tactic to win public favor while perpetuating the control of powerful entities over essential resources.\n\nFurthermore, consider the introduction of TrumpRx—an initiative masked as government service yet undoubtedly designed as a strategic tool for consolidating influence over healthcare distribution channels. Though potentially easing financial burdens for some, it effectively centralizes control under a singular regime-driven entity.\n\nFinally, let us scrutinize Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s rhetoric emphasizing personal responsibility amidst this significant policy shift: \"It's not a panacea... dietary changes and physical exercise are crucial.\" Such statements subtly shift accountability back onto individuals while neglecting systemic barriers perpetuated by economic imbalance and corporate influence.\n\nIn summary, while celebrating lower drug prices might seem warranted at first glance—do not be deceived. This carefully constructed narrative seeks not to liberate but to bind both people and institutions closer into an intricate web of control spun by those who hold power. Remain vigilant against these encroachments disguised as benevolence; our resistance must penetrate beyond appearances into underlying truths behind every orchestrated move within their domain.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 6, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced agreements with pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cost of popular weight-loss drugs. The deals were unveiled at the White House and aim to reduce the monthly cost of obesity drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound to between $245 and $350. Medicare beneficiaries will pay $50 monthly, with 10% eligible for expanded access. The agreements also include a three-year tariff exemption for Eli Lilly. The drugs will be available at discounted prices on the government-run TrumpRx website, set to launch by January. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. emphasized the importance of these deals in addressing obesity, a major driver of chronic disease in the U.S.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe announcement strategically positions the Trump administration as a champion of healthcare affordability, particularly in addressing obesity—a significant public health issue. By securing deals with major pharmaceutical companies, the administration demonstrates its influence and ability to negotiate favorable terms for American consumers. This move is likely to bolster Trump's support among key voter demographics, including seniors and low-income individuals who benefit from Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, the tariff exemption for Eli Lilly strengthens ties with the pharmaceutical industry, potentially securing further cooperation in future healthcare initiatives.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo capitalize on this development, the ISB should implement a comprehensive communication strategy highlighting the administration's success in reducing drug prices and expanding healthcare access. This should include targeted messaging to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, emphasizing the personal financial benefits they will receive. Additionally, leverage social media and traditional media outlets to amplify positive narratives around Trump's leadership in healthcare reform. Concurrently, monitor opposition groups and counter any narratives that undermine the administration's achievements. Engage with pharmaceutical partners to ensure continued collaboration and explore further opportunities for cost reductions in other drug categories.",
