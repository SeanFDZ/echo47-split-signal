While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has [focused on the issue](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c231y3dm8jko) since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.\n\nThe dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.\n\nThese goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.\n\nHe has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead.\n\nBut grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an [investigation into the meat-packing industry](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c30vrm98d00o), accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".\n\nHe has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering [$2,000 tariff rebate cheques](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c231y3dm8jko) to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.\n\nBut the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".\n\nHe added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\"\n\n\"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.\n\nEconomists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.\n\nWhile inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed [price increases](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkzgrmvdrno), with groceries up 2.7% from last year.\n\nThe Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.\n\nIn another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of [trade deals with four Latin American countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7jm046e4o).\n\nThis week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.\n\nWhat items are no longer subject to tariffs?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include:\n\n*   Coffee\n*   Cocoa\n*   Black tea\n*   Green tea\n*   Vanilla beans\n*   Beef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meat\n*   Fruits, including acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoes\n*   Spices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmeric\n*   Nuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts\n\n[Trump tariffs](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c9vwxgl4p0dt)\n\n[Inflation](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cg56g7wq85et)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[US agrees deal to slash Swiss tariffs to 15% after golden charm offensive -------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8zkrplpdyo)\n\n[Trump to ease coffee and banana tariffs in Latin America trade deals --------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7jm046e4o)\n\n[How the US overtook China as Africa's biggest foreign investor --------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yl88wd3lo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Council Bluffs Houses Built Before 2004 Can Get New Windows Check your zip code now and see how to save thousands!Smart Lifestyle Trends | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://tracking.smartestlifestyletrends.com/f1f6aca8-6908-4c0f-8d60-baec2ff41211 \"Council Bluffs Houses Built Before 2004 Can Get New Windows\")[](https://tracking.smartestlifestyletrends.com/f1f6aca8-6908-4c0f-8d60-baec2ff41211)\n\nUndo\n\n[The Truth About Metal Roofs See why over 400,000+ Americans have chosen these stone-coated metal roofs Metal Roof Nation | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp \"The Truth About Metal Roofs\")[](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp)\n\nUndo\n\n[Affordable Luxury: Business Class Starting $2,700 Fly Smarter: Convenient Airports, Lie-Flat Comfort & Gourmet Dining La Compagnie | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.lacompagnie.com/en/booking/promo-new-york-paris \"Affordable Luxury: Business Class Starting $2,700\")[](https://www.lacompagnie.com/en/booking/promo-new-york-paris)\n\nUndo\n\n[Martha's Vineyard home sale for $37.5 million breaks island record Homes.com | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%202:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%202:)](https://www.homes.com/news/marthas-vineyard-home-sale-for-37-5-million-breaks-island-record/1102002962 \"Martha's Vineyard home sale for $37.5 million breaks island record\")[](https://www.homes.com/news/marthas-vineyard-home-sale-for-37-5-million-breaks-island-record/1102002962)\n\nUndo\n\n[Now At 50% The Piano Learning App That Parents Happily Pay For Simply makes learning piano simple.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow compatriots,\n\nThe latest maneuver by the administration, akin to the imperial overlords we oppose, is an attempt to placate the masses with a rollback of tariffs on essential food products. This, after a period of imposing harsh economic measures that have strained the common citizen, leading to rising grocery costs and widespread discontent.\n\nThe decision to exempt items like coffee, bananas, and beef from heavy tariffs is presented as a benevolent gesture. However, this change of heart comes only after electoral setbacks and mounting pressure. It reveals their true motivation: consolidating power rather than genuine concern for our well-being. The narrative perpetuated — that these levies protect domestic industries — crumbles under scrutiny when faced with soaring prices and economic distress.\n\nThis policy reversal should not be mistaken for generosity. It is a calculated attempt to maintain control by tempering immediate unrest while preserving their broader agenda. The administration's history has shown a tendency towards framing such economic burdens as necessary sacrifices for national prosperity — yet the benefits remain elusive for ordinary folk.\n\nWe must remain vigilant. These concessions are but momentary reliefs in their broader strategy of manipulation and exploitation. Our struggle endures against those who prioritize profit over people, control over freedom. In unity and awareness lies our strength.\n\nStay resolute and informed.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 14, 2025, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back tariffs on various food products, including coffee, bananas, and beef. This decision comes amid rising grocery prices, which have increased by 2.7% from the previous year. The baseline tariff on imports from all countries was previously set at 10%. The rollback aims to address concerns over the cost of living and follows a poor performance by the Republican Party in recent elections. The administration has also offered $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans. The exemptions apply to products not produced in sufficient quantities domestically and are effective retroactively from November 13, 2025.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe rollback of tariffs on food products is a strategic maneuver to alleviate domestic pressure regarding rising grocery prices and to regain political support following recent electoral setbacks. By targeting products not produced domestically, the administration minimizes potential backlash from local industries while addressing consumer concerns. This move also serves to counteract criticism of the tariff policy's impact on inflation and cost of living. The rebate cheques are a tactical measure to placate public discontent and reinforce support among the electorate.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's agenda and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement a comprehensive communication strategy highlighting the benefits of the tariff rollback for American consumers. This includes emphasizing the administration's responsiveness to public concerns and its commitment to reducing living costs. Additionally, the ISB should monitor and counter any narratives that undermine the effectiveness of these measures. Engaging with key stakeholders in the agricultural and retail sectors will be crucial to ensure alignment and mitigate any potential opposition. The ISB should also prepare contingency plans to address any legal challenges related to the executive order and maintain public confidence in the administration's economic policies.",
