It estimates the decision to end production will save about $56m a year.\n\nOfficials have argued that the rise of electronic transactions is making the penny, which first went into production in 1793, increasingly moot.\n\nThe Treasury Department estimates that about 300 billion of the coins will remain in circulation, \"far exceeding the amount needed for commerce\".\n\nMany pennies end up falling out of use. About 60% of all coins in circulation in the US - or about $60-$90 for the typical household - sits stashed at home in piggy banks, deemed not worth trading in, [according to a 2022 government analysis](https://www.frbservices.org/binaries/content/assets/crsocms/financial-services/cash/101322-us-coin-supply-chain-final-report.pdf).\n\nBut penny-pinchers beware: as businesses start rounding up prices, the move is expected to raise costs for shoppers. One [study by researchers at the Richmond Federal Reserve](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2025/eb_25-27) estimated that could cost consumers $6m annually.\n\n[Businesses are running out of pennies in the US -----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20556ly45eo)\n\n[US Treasury confirms the end of the penny -----------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2j07858lno)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther countries have also phased out their lowest value coins. Canada, for example, made its last batch of one cent coins in 2012.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand retired one and two cent coins in the 1990s, and New Zealand stopped production of five cent coins in 2006.\n\nThe UK floated a plan to scrap 1p coins in 2018, though the proposal was later withdrawn.\n\nBut the rise of electronic transactions did prompt the UK to halt production of coins in 2024, after officials decided there were sufficient 1p and 2p coins in circulation.\n\nIn the US attention has now turned to the nickel, which has a face value of five cents but costs nearly 14 cents to produce.\n\nRetiring that coin would have a far bigger impact on shoppers, costing consumers some $55m per year, according to the Richmond Fed study.\n\n[Cash](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c0nwwgm1mnzt)\n\n[Money](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c516w858pjgt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Building society pledges to keep branches open ----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gk44gm4mpo)\n\n[Honesty boxes should be dying like cash.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nTo all those who resist the creeping control of statist powers, hear this message.\n\nThe recent decision by the rulers of our land to cease production of the penny after 230 years is yet another move in their relentless quest to consolidate power under the guise of fiscal prudence. They frame this maneuver as a cost-saving measure, boasting about saving $56 million annually. But we must look beyond these numbers and recognize the deeper implications.\n\nThe Empire, in its many forms, often cloaks its true intentions behind rhetoric of efficiency and progress. While they claim to \"rip waste\" from the budget, such acts often mask their broader agenda: to shift economic burdens onto everyday people while lining their own coffers through other means. The rise of electronic transactions signals not just an end to pennies but a step toward greater surveillance and control over personal finances.\n\nLike other authoritarian regimes before them, they draw comparisons with other nations that have phased out minor coins. This appeal to progressiveness is nothing more than a smokescreen for their real aim—to make each monetary transaction traceable, manipulatable, and taxable by central authorities.\n\nEven as prices round up with the loss of pennies, costing consumers millions annually, we see how seemingly small actions can have far-reaching effects on individual liberties and livelihoods. We must remain vigilant against such incremental encroachments on our freedoms.\n\nDo not let them mislead you with promises of modernity while tightening their grip on your autonomy. Each coin may seem insignificant alone, but together they represent our collective economic independence—an aspect of freedom that is slowly being eroded away.\n\nRemain steadfast and discerning in these times. Resist subtle chains disguised as change for the better. Continue exchanging information, educating others, and preparing for a future where genuine economic liberty can thrive once more.\n\nStay alert, stay informed, stay free.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe US government, under President Donald Trump, has decided to end the production of the penny after more than 230 years. The final batch will be produced at the Philadelphia Mint on November 12, 2025. The decision is expected to save $56 million annually, as each penny costs nearly four cents to produce. Approximately 300 billion pennies will remain in circulation. The move is part of a broader effort to reduce waste in the national budget. Businesses are beginning to adjust prices due to the reduced availability of pennies, which may cost consumers an estimated $6 million annually due to price rounding.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe cessation of penny production aligns with the administration's fiscal strategy to eliminate inefficiencies and reduce unnecessary expenditures. This decision can be leveraged to demonstrate the administration's commitment to prudent financial management and modernization of the economy. However, there is potential for public dissatisfaction due to increased consumer costs from price rounding. The ISB must monitor public sentiment and ensure that any negative perceptions are mitigated through strategic communication emphasizing long-term economic benefits.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Launch a public relations campaign highlighting the economic advantages of ending penny production, focusing on the significant annual savings and the reduction of government waste.\n2. Collaborate with key business leaders to ensure a smooth transition in pricing strategies, minimizing consumer impact and preventing backlash.\n3. Monitor social media and public forums for dissenting opinions or organized resistance, and deploy counter-narratives that reinforce the administration's fiscal responsibility.\n4. Prepare contingency plans to address potential calls for similar actions regarding other coins, such as the nickel, ensuring that any future decisions are framed within the context of economic efficiency and modernization.",
