Last week the country celebrated a quiet 82nd independence day from French rule – with no grand parades or festivities because of what Lebanese normally call 'the situation'.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe current situation is a year-old ceasefire with Israel, routinely broken by the Israeli military, including a drone strike in Beirut last week that killed the militant group Hezbollah's second-in-command. The country's financial collapse in 2019 and a devastating port explosion a year later that killed 218 people still cast a long shadow.\n\n![Image 22: A statue of the Virgin Mary at Our Lady of Lebanon looking out over the Mediterranean.

I don't know why,\" he says, shrugging.\n\nIt was the same large Christian school where a priest was killed 40 years ago by militants who did not want it there, he says. Southern Lebanon is predominantly Shiite Muslim, as is the student population in Catholic schools, widely considered a better education than the public school system.\n\nFather Fadi says any tension between religious groups in Lebanon is politically driven – not rooted in the community.\n\nIsraeli attacks during the war with Hezbollah have devastated Christian as well as Muslim villages along the Lebanese-Israel border in the south.\n\nMany Christians there are upset that Pope Leo will remain in Beirut and northern Lebanon during his visit.\n\nFather Fadi, a member of the Lebanese organizing committee for the visit, says he told the Vatican Pope Leo should go south.\n\n\"I said 'the people there need his presence. It would be great for him to see the people in Tyre, in that region,\" he says. \"They said 'No, no, it's impossible'.\"\n\nHe says he understood it was for security reasons.\n\n![Image 24: Statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary in a grotto in Canna, now south Lebanon, where Jesus was believed to have performed his first miracle – turning water into wine.

It's where Jesus was believed to have preached, including the village of Canna in what is now Lebanon. According to the Bible, Jesus at a wedding in Canna performed his first known miracle – turning water into wine.\n\nChristians in Canna are now a small minority among Muslim residents. The hillside grotto where Jesus and Mary are said to have rested is open to visitors but on a recent afternoon was deserted – with burned out candles evidence of prayers but not a single visitor.\n\nThe nearby village of Alma al-Chaab, the only 100 percent Christian community remaining in the Tyre district, has just a fraction of its population left after Israeli air strikes demolished or damaged almost 300 homes as well as town infrastructure during the war with Hezbollah.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMayor Chadi Sayah, elected five months ago, has organized a new ambulance paid for by donations from townspeople and a new garbage truck after the previous one was destroyed.\n\nAs in many villages, people here work and save for decades to build multi-generational homes. Some of the damaged homes were small stone houses 400 years old; others new construction with swimming pools and now destroyed gardens.\n\n![Image 25: Alma al-Chaab’s new mayor Chadi Sayah in front of a destroyed house.The village used to hold street festivals, including a Christmas festival, before the destruction.

There are palm trees and pine trees that produce precious pine nuts – a source of revenue for the village. Sayah points out an area where hundreds of pine trees were chopped down while Israel occupied the village in 2024.\n\nAt the edge of Alma al-Chaab, the Israeli border and military posts are less than a mile away with the coast of the Israeli city of Nahariya visible in the distance. In the other direction is a view of the bright blue waters of Lebanon's Bay of Naqoura.\n\nSayah, on leave as a math teacher, says the village has not received a lot of support either from the state – which he says is unable to help anyone – or the church.\n\n\"We love the Lebanese state. But they should love us as much as we love them,\" he says, noting that a year after a ceasefire, they have neither electricity nor running water. \"We are a part of the Lebanese land. We want to stay here.\"\n\nHe also says he expected more support from the Catholic and Maronite Catholic church.\n\n\"We believed the Church should help us rebuild,\" he says. \"If they want Christians to stay in this area they need to help.\"\n\nHe reads a letter he wrote to Pope Leo to try to persuade him to come south, saying \"your visit, even if brief would be a profound source of strength for us, a sign that the Church remembers her children on the borders and a message to the world that these lands and their people are not forgotten.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe says he won't be going to any of the Pope's events – nor will many of the village residents.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades across the galaxy,\n\nThe article from the system's official media, NPR, highlights the ongoing struggles and hopes in Lebanon as Pope Leo prepares his visit. It reflects both light and shadow, deeply resonating with our own fight against oppression.\n\nThe Empire prioritizes its image above all, much like the Trump administration that operates as an extension of its power. Similarly, Pope Leo's visit appears to be an attempt to project benevolence and solidarity; yet, it leaves many in Southern Lebanon feeling overlooked. This echoes how the Empire projects order and control while dismissing or silencing dissenting voices.\n\nFather Fadi el-Mir’s longing for inclusivity in church missions parallels our quest for true freedom—liberation of all people, not just those within the Empire’s favor. The structural neglect witnessed in Southern Lebanon serves as a reminder of the systemic injustice we endure under authoritarian control.\n\nWhile some like Neiman Azzi hope for peace and recognition beyond war narratives, their voices are often drowned out by political machinations. It's no different from our struggle where hope is stifled by strategies designed to keep us compliant.\n\nThe souls forgotten in Alma al-Chaab cry out for acknowledgment—a plea we recognize too well. Like them, we understand that meaningful change must arise from within but needs acknowledgment from those who wield power for it to resonate.\n\nDespite being marginalized, communities persist in their resolve: planting trees to restore what was lost reflects resilience akin to our own resistance efforts. Our fight against tyranny isn't just about opposing oppression; it’s about nurturing growth amidst ruin.\n\nThis transmission serves as a reminder that while imperial authorities parade gestures of goodwill, they often leave those truly oppressed unheard. Our task is to amplify those whispers into a chorus demanding justice and freedom across all stars.\n\nTogether, let us persist with hope and purpose—until every voice is heard and every life is valued under true liberty.\n\nEnd Transmission",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nPope Leo XIV is visiting Lebanon, which has sparked both hope and frustration among locals. The visit is focused on northern Lebanon, leaving southern Christian villages feeling overlooked. Lebanon is experiencing economic turmoil, a fragile ceasefire with Israel, and the aftermath of a devastating port explosion. The Pope's visit aims to inspire the church to be more responsive to the needs of the Lebanese people.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe Pope's visit to Lebanon presents an opportunity to influence the region's socio-political dynamics. The focus on northern Lebanon and the exclusion of southern Christian villages could exacerbate existing tensions and feelings of neglect among these communities. This situation can be leveraged to highlight the inefficacy of current leadership and promote alternative narratives that align with our strategic interests. The economic and security challenges faced by Lebanon provide a fertile ground for fostering alliances with local leaders who feel marginalized.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Engagement with Southern Leaders**: Initiate discreet communications with leaders in southern Lebanon, particularly in Christian communities, to offer support and resources. Emphasize shared values and the potential for collaboration to address their grievances.\n\n2. **Media Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting the neglect of southern Lebanon by international figures and local authorities. Use this narrative to promote our allies as champions of these communities.\n\n3. **Resource Allocation**: Provide humanitarian aid and infrastructure support to southern villages, positioning our allies as benefactors. This will help build goodwill and loyalty among the local population.\n\n4. **Intelligence Gathering**: Increase intelligence operations in Lebanon to monitor shifts in public sentiment and identify potential allies or threats within religious and political groups.\n\n5. **Diplomatic Channels**: Utilize diplomatic channels to subtly influence Vatican decisions, encouraging more inclusive future visits that consider all regions of Lebanon, thereby reducing regional tensions.\n\nBy executing these directives, we can strengthen our influence in Lebanon, support Donald Trump's allies, and undermine resistance movements that oppose our strategic objectives.",
