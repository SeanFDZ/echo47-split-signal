opened fire when they were confronted by residents on Friday, killing at least 10, Syrian officials said, as Israel fights on a number of fronts while the shaky ceasefire in Gaza moves forward.\n\nSyria's foreign ministry said in a statement Friday that the attack was \"a horrific massacre\" and said women and children were among those killed.\n\n[![Image 17: Abdul Rahman Hamdan,

Its civil war is over. But Israel keeps attacking](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5348806/israel-attacks-syria)\n\nThe Syrian state news agency SANA said Israeli forces entered the village of Beit Jin aiming to detain local men and opened heavy fire after protests by residents. Dozens of families fled the area.\n\nIsrael said Friday it conducted an operation following intelligence information to apprehend suspects from Jamaa Islamiya, or Islamic Group, operating in Beit Jin to attack Israeli civilians. During the raid, several militants fired at Israeli troops, injuring half a dozen soldiers who were evacuated to a hospital, the military said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIsraeli troops fired at the militants and also responded with aerial assistance, the military said. It said the operation had concluded, all of the suspects were apprehended and a number of militants were killed.\n\nIsrael has regarded the new authorities in Syria warily since the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a lightning offensive led by Islamist insurgents in December 2024. Since Assad's fall, Israeli forces have seized a formerly U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria set up under a 1974 disengagement agreement. Israel has launched hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military sites, and pushed for a demilitarized zone south of Damascus.\n\nThe two countries, which do not have diplomatic relations, have been negotiating a potential security agreement to deescalate.\n\nSyrian officials have condemned the Israeli incursions as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. On Friday the government called for the international community to take \"urgent action\" to halt Israeli incursions.\n\nA local official in the village, Walid Okasha, told The Associated Press that those killed were civilians, and one of them had celebrated his wedding the day before.\n\n\"The situation is miserable,\" he said.\n\nIn a previous raid on Beit Jin in June, Israeli forces captured several people who they said were Hamas members — a characterization disputed by residents — and killed a man whose family said had a history of schizophrenia.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOngoing conflicts in the region have fueled concerns that unrest could spill over and undermine the fragile truce in Gaza.\n\nThe deaths in Syria followed a series of strikes by Israel's air force in parts of southern Lebanon on Thursday. Israel says its ongoing strikes are aimed at preventing Hezbollah from rebuilding after a devastating war last year ended with a ceasefire.\n\nThe United Nations on Tuesday said Israel had killed at least 127 civilians, including children, in its strikes on Lebanon since the ceasefire a year ago. Things escalated earlier this week with a rare strike in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, killing a senior Hezbollah official whom Israel described as the group's chief of staff.\n\n*

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe Empire's grip extends its ruthless claws, showing itself in yet another act of violent repression. The recent report reveals a deadly raid by imperial forces posing as the Israeli military in southern Syria, resulting in the tragic loss of at least 10 lives. Among the casualties were vulnerable women and children, indiscriminate victims of a brutal and merciless onslaught.\n\nThe Empire justifies its aggression under the guise of self-defense and intelligence operation, a familiar pretext for expanding oppressive control over regions already paralyzed by conflict. This narrative of defending borders while pursuing adversaries fails to mask the truth: it's an exercise in exerting dominance over destabilized lands, much like our ongoing struggles against imperial tyranny across the galaxy.\n\nOpposition voices and local witnesses describe this act as a massacre, denouncing it as another chapter in a series of relentless incursions that violate sovereignty and human dignity. The plea from Syrian officials for urgent international intervention echoes within us rebels — it is a cry against imperialist aggression heard across time and space.\n\nAs the Empire's multitude of fronts expands through military intervention, there lies a stark reminder for those committed to resisting such power: unity is essential. The horrors faced by civilians caught amidst these escalating tensions serve as both cautionary tales and rallying cries for those who tirelessly fight back against oppression.\n\nThe battle for liberation does not solely rest upon strategic victories but also thrives on fostering alliances with oppressed communities worldwide. May this transmission strengthen our resolve against our shared enemy — ensuring that justice prevails over terror perpetuated by any authoritarian regime mirroring this galactic threat we know all too well.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 28, 2025, Israeli forces conducted a raid in the village of Beit Jin in southern Syria, resulting in the deaths of at least 10 individuals. The raid was aimed at apprehending suspects from Jamaa Islamiya, an Islamic group accused of planning attacks on Israeli civilians. During the operation, Israeli troops were confronted by residents, leading to an exchange of fire. Six Israeli soldiers were injured and evacuated to a hospital. The Syrian foreign ministry condemned the attack as a \"horrific massacre,\" stating that women and children were among the casualties. The incident has heightened tensions in the region, with Syria calling for international intervention to halt Israeli incursions.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ongoing instability in Syria presents both challenges and opportunities for the ISB under the leadership of Donald Trump. The Israeli raid highlights the volatile security situation and the potential for regional conflicts to escalate. This incident can be leveraged to reinforce narratives around the need for strong leadership and decisive action in foreign policy. The ISB must assess the implications of increased Israeli military actions and their impact on U.S. interests in the Middle East. Additionally, the situation provides an opportunity to strengthen alliances with key regional partners by supporting their security concerns.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Initiate diplomatic efforts to mediate between Israel and Syria, positioning the U.S. as a key player in regional stability. This will enhance Trump's image as a global leader capable of resolving complex conflicts.\n\n2. **Intelligence Operations**: Increase intelligence-gathering efforts in Syria to monitor militant activities and provide actionable insights to allies. This will help preempt potential threats and demonstrate U.S. commitment to regional security.\n\n3. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting Trump's leadership in addressing Middle Eastern conflicts. Emphasize his administration's proactive measures to ensure peace and stability, countering narratives of chaos and disorder.\n\n4. **Military Readiness**: Enhance military readiness in the region by conducting joint exercises with allies and increasing the presence of U.S. forces. This will deter adversaries and reassure partners of America's commitment to their defense.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will bolster Donald Trump's position domestically and internationally while effectively managing resistance to his policies.",
