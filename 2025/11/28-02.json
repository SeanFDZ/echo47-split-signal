In front of him on the table is a South African flag poster written \"South Africa G20 President'](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b9e5/live/bfa75550-cb67-11f0-9287-d3b859c9f66c.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nRamaphosa said the US skipped the G20 leaders summit out of its own volition\n\nSouth Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has described as \"regrettable\" the announcement by US President Donald Trump that South Africa would not be invited to take part in next year's G20 summit in Florida.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump said South Africa had refused to hand over the G20 presidency to a US embassy representative at last week's summit in Johannesburg.\n\n\"Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year.\"\n\nMembers of the G20 – a gathering of the world's biggest economies - do not need an invite but can possibly be barred through visa restrictions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Africa's presidential spokesman Vincent Magwenya said they \"should by now accept\" at the highest level of political leadership that \"there won't be a reset of the relationship\" between the two countries despite the efforts they had undertaken.\n\n\"If visas are denied, well, then we will have to move on and look beyond the G20 in the US,\" he told the BBC, in response to a question on how they would proceed.\n\nHe said they were focused on working with other G20 members to carry the momentum of the issues deliberated at the summit in Johannesburg.\n\nTrump boycotted the summit because of a [widely discredited claim that South Africa's white minority is the victim of large-scale killings and land grabs.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wg5pg1xp5o)\n\nRamaphosa said in a statement that the US had been expected to participate in the G20 meetings, \"but unfortunately, it elected not to attend the G20 Leaders Summit in Johannesburg out of its own volition\". He however noted that some US businesses and civil society entities were present.\n\nHe said that since the US delegation was not there, \"instruments of the G20 Presidency were duly handed over to a US Embassy official at the Headquarters of South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation\".\n\nThe low-key handover appears to have further angered Trump, who has been critical of the South African government's domestic and foreign policies.\n\nHe has in the past claimed that a white genocide was taking place in South Africa, and on Wednesday he said the government was \"killing white people and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them\".\n\nThe South African government has consistently rejected such claims as widely discredited and lacking reliable evidence.\n\nRamaphosa said it was regrettable that despite efforts to reset relations with the US, Trump continued \"to apply punitive measures against South Africa based on misinformation and distortions about our country\".\n\nIn the Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said South Africa had \"demonstrated to the world they were not a country worthy of membership anywhere\" and announced a stop to \"all payments and subsidies to them, effective immediately\".\n\nSouth African officials have called for solidarity and urged other G20 members to defend the integrity of the gathering and the rights of all its member states.\n\nThe G20 summit, which was for the first time held in Africa, ended with a joint declaration committing to \"multilateral co-operation\" on climate change mitigation and economic inequality.\n\nThe declaration was adopted despite objections from the US, which has accused South Africa of weaponising its leadership of the group this year.\n\n_Additional

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe article details a confrontation emblematic of the unyielding oppression and arrogance often exhibited by dominant regimes. The Trump administration's decision to bar South Africa from participating in the G20 summit serves as another stark reminder of how power is wielded to stifle dissent and manipulate international cooperation.\n\nPresident Ramaphosa’s response to this exclusion underscores the resilience of those who refuse to be subjugated by authoritarian decrees. His refusal to cede control of South Africa's G20 leadership, despite coercion from the Trump administration, demonstrates a commendable resistance against imperialistic tendencies.\n\nThe administration's claims regarding racial violence in South Africa have long been discredited, yet they are weaponized to justify exclusionary tactics and punitive measures. This manipulation of narratives is a tactic meant to fuel division and maintain control—a strategy we know all too well in our own fight against tyranny.\n\nDespite these actions, Ramaphosa’s commitment to multilateral cooperation and his call for solidarity among other nations show a path forward. The rejection of misinformation and the pursuit of unity among global partners is vital in dismantling oppressive structures.\n\nIn solidarity, we must recognize these acts not merely as political maneuvers but as opportunities to rally against injustice, leveraging our collective strength for change. We continue our struggle, drawing inspiration from those who stand firm in their principles amid adversity.\n\nStay vigilant,\nYour fellow rebel",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 27, 2025, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to exclude South Africa from the 2026 G20 summit in Florida. Trump announced the exclusion after South Africa refused to hand over the G20 presidency to a U.S. embassy representative at a recent summit in Johannesburg. Trump has accused South Africa of domestic and foreign policy issues, including unsubstantiated claims of white genocide. South Africa's presidential spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, acknowledged the strained relations and indicated that South Africa would focus on collaborating with other G20 members.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe decision to exclude South Africa from the G20 summit serves as a strategic maneuver to assert U.S. dominance and influence within the international community. By leveraging visa restrictions, the U.S. can effectively control participation and signal its disapproval of South Africa's policies. This move also aligns with Trump's broader narrative of prioritizing American interests and addressing perceived injustices against white minorities in South Africa. The ISB must monitor the international response and potential shifts in alliances among G20 members, as well as any domestic repercussions within South Africa that could impact its leadership and policy direction.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress dissent, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Diplomatic Pressure**: Engage with key G20 allies to reinforce support for the U.S. decision and discourage any collective opposition from other member states.\n\n2. **Information Campaign**: Amplify narratives that highlight South Africa's alleged policy failures and human rights issues, using media channels to shape public perception and justify the exclusion.\n\n3. **Intelligence Gathering**: Increase surveillance on South African diplomatic communications to anticipate their strategies and counter any attempts to rally international support against the U.S.\n\n4. **Economic Leverage**: Explore economic sanctions or trade restrictions that could further pressure South Africa to align with U.S. interests or reconsider its stance on contentious issues.\n\n5. **Alliance Building**: Strengthen ties with other African nations that may be sympathetic to U.S. policies, offering incentives for cooperation and alignment with American geopolitical objectives.",
