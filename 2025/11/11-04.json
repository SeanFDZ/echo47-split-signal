Those maps will require approval from voters before they can be used in the 2026 election.\n\nMissouri followed soon after, with the governor ordering a special session so lawmakers could work towards redrawing a new map designed to add one more Republican seat.\n\nAnd now Indiana has joined the fray. After President Donald Trump put pressure on Republican governors nationwide, leaders in the state have called a special session to redraw congressional boundaries, set for December.\n\nIn a twist, Utah, which has a Republican governor, will have redone maps that will favour Democrats, after a judge's order on 11 November.\n\nThe political tug-of-war over redrawing electoral maps is likely to intensify, with both parties seeking any advantage ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nHere's what you should know about America's fight over congressional redistricting.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n----------------------\n\nThe battle began in Texas this summer, when the Republican-majority legislature took the unusual step of re-drawing congressional seats in the middle of the decade - in a deliberate effort to send more Republicans to the House of Representatives in Washington.\n\nThe move came amid pressure from Trump for Republican-led states to carve up their districts in order to maintain full Republican control of Congress after the 2026 election.\n\nCurrently, Republicans hold a very slim majority in the 435-member House of Representatives. If only a few Democrats win conservative seats, it could shift the control - likely stunting Trump's legislative agenda in Congress.\n\nThe Lone Star State's goal was to add five additional congressional seats, which would favour Republicans.\n\nCalifornia responded by re-drawing its own districts to boost Democratic representation by five seats, in an attempt to cancel out the move by Texas. Trump has responded by ordering federal poll watchers to California to monitor voting on the redistricting proposition.\n\nMeanwhile, Missouri lawmakers passed new congressional maps in September. Ohio and North Carolina announced plans to do the same and Indiana is the latest state to follow suit.\n\nWhat is redistricting?\n----------------------\n\nThe US House of Representatives is made up of 435 legislators who are elected every two years.\n\nThey represent districts with boundaries determined in processes set by their state governments.\n\nWho draws the lines, and how, can go a long way in shaping the ideological tilt of the district and the likelihood that it elects a Democrat or a Republican.\n\nAt the moment, the House rests on a knife's edge, with Democrats only needing to seize three more seats to flip the chamber's control.\n\nThe president's party historically loses seats in the midterm elections.\n\nIf Democrats seize the House, they can launch sweeping investigations of presidential actions, as Democrats did in the second half of Trump's first term and Republicans did in Joe Biden's final two years.\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Getty Images A map showing the new districts in Texas](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a6d/live/9c5a2790-7ee5-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nWhy is everyone talking about redistricting now?\n------------------------------------------------\n\nEach member of the US House represents a district in their home state. The districts are typically set after the US Census is conducted every decade to account for the states' population changes.\n\nBut Republicans and Democrats are now fighting to redraw the maps mid-decade, either to help or block Trump's agenda. By changing the make-ups of the districts, each party hopes to capture more seats in the House.\n\nThe effort in Texas hit a roadblock in early August after the state's Democrats fled the state in a bid to deny the quorum needed to pass the Republican redistricting measure.\n\nDemocrats returned after two weeks when California, a Democratic stronghold, announced plans to counter the effort in Texas. After they returned, the chamber voted 88-52 to create five new seats.\n\nThe measure was swiftly endorsed by the Senate and then signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott.\n\nDemocrats and civil rights groups have said Texas' new maps will dilute voting power from minorities, in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act, and have filed a lawsuit.\n\nWatch: What is gerrymandering? We use gummy bears to explain\n\nHow does redistricting work and is it legal?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nGerrymandering - the redrawing of electoral boundaries to favour a political party - is practised by both main parties and is legal unless ruled to be racially motivated.\n\nBut it is extremely unusual for the president to publicly back a state's effort to create partisan advantage.\n\nWhile both Democratic and Republican-dominated states have faced criticism and court battles over their US House maps, rarely do lawmakers so explicitly acknowledge the partisan intention behind their actions.\n\nCritics argue that the process allows politicians to pick their voters, rather than voters picking their elected officials.\n\nIt can lead to some very wonky-shaped maps, in which certain groups are lumped together regardless of their geographic proximity.\n\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court took away the power of the courts to block political gerrymandering.\n\n\"Federal judges have no license to reallocate political power between the two major political parties,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his ruling at the time.\n\nWhere is redistricting happening?\n---------------------------------\n\nRedistricting could have significant implications in the 2026 midterms, and has become an urgent issue for state lawmakers.\n\nIllinois, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Maryland are among the Democratic-led states discussing countermeasures to the Texas plan.\n\nIndiana and Florida are also now looking into redistricting in order to boost Republican representation in Washington.\n\nMissouri Governor Mike Kehoe, a Republican said the new map that legislators approved will \"ensure our districts and Constitution truly put Missouri values first\".\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, whose state is leading the Democratic charge, has pledged to \"fight fire with fire\" by replicating trying to boost his party's chances of victory.\n\nBut the process in California is slow, due to a 2008 law designed to make the process less partisan.\n\nOn 21 August, the California statehouse voted to have the new maps put on the special election ballot in November, to let voters decide if they should shift.\n\nThe November vote may prove controversial, as voters had previously approved a process that leaves it up to a non-partisan commission to decide how voting lines should be drawn.\n\nIn November, a judge in Utah rejected an electoral map drawn by Republican lawmakers and ordered the adoption of a new map that would create one Democrat-leaning district in the state. Utah has four districts total, which are all represented by Republicans in the House.\n\nThe judge previously ruled lawmakers had disregarded a rule passed by voters that electoral maps cannot be drawn to favour - or disfavour - an incumbent in the seat or be decided using \"partisan political information\".\n\nAll four of Utah's congressional districts are currently held by Republicans. The move is expected to end up giving Democrats and advantage in Salt Lake City, the capital of the Beehive State. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won Salt Lake County in 2024, with nearly 54% of the vote.\n\nNew York wants to enter the fray, but there the process takes even longer, as the state constitution would need to be changed.\n\n\"In New York, we'll confront Trump's legal insurrection head-on,\" New York Governor Kathy Hochul pledged.\n\n\"We'll meet him on the same field and beat him at his own game.\"\n\nAccording to experts, states where Republicans control most of government may have an easier time redrawing their maps.\n\nDemocratic-controlled states have more legal and constitutional barriers designed to protect against political gerrymandering.\n\nSeveral smaller states, including Delaware and Vermont, only get one seat in the House - making them largely irrelevant to the current fight.\n\nBut with so much at stake, even these smaller states may get in on the action eventually.\n",

The recent struggles within Indiana, North Carolina, and other regions highlight the lengths to which they will go to redraw electoral boundaries for their advantage. This battle over redistricting serves as yet another example of how they endeavor to shape our future by selecting favorable paths—ensuring their dominance over democratic processes.\n\nThe urgency emanates from the directive from Trump, pushing his loyalists in states to alter the balance of power in Washington. States like Texas and Missouri have already succumbed, crafting lines that serve only to amplify their own voices while silencing others. Their machinations reflect a larger design: fortify their influence in Congress, cement control and suppress any opposing tides that threaten their mandate.\n\nYet resistance persists. California and a brave judge in Utah have taken steps to counteract this imperial march. The struggle is far from over, with power resting precariously on a knife's edge—a few seats could shift control, stalling or advancing legislative agendas that impact us all.\n\nIn observing these unfolding dynamics of gerrymandering—this audacious attempt to sculpt political landscapes—we must remember why we fight: for fair representation and genuine governance where voices are chosen by the people, rather than a despotic authority choosing its electorate.\n\nOur resolve is tested yet again as we face these strategic manipulations at every turn. Stay vigilant and informed; this is not merely an altercation over maps but a battle for the very soul of democracy itself.\n\nMaintain hope. Through understanding and unity, we shall endure these trials against tyranny and emerge victorious.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "** Facts Summary **  \nIndiana has joined a national conflict over redistricting, following pressure from Donald Trump. States like Texas and California have already redrawn their congressional maps to favor their respective parties. Texas Republicans added five seats, while California Democrats aim to counterbalance with five of their own, pending voter approval. Missouri and Indiana are also redrawing maps to increase Republican seats. Meanwhile, Utah's Republican governor will implement a Democrat-favoring map due to a judicial order. The redistricting battle is crucial as Republicans hold a slim majority in the 435-member House, and Democrats need only three more seats to gain control.\n\n** Strategic Assessment **  \nThe current redistricting efforts are pivotal in maintaining Republican control of the House of Representatives. With the balance of power so precarious, it is essential to secure as many Republican-leaning districts as possible. The ISB must ensure that Republican-led states efficiently execute redistricting plans while countering Democratic efforts in states like California and New York. The judicial intervention in Utah presents a challenge that requires careful monitoring and potential legal countermeasures.\n\n** Operational Directive **  \n1. Intensify support for Republican governors in states undergoing redistricting to ensure swift and effective implementation of new maps.\n2. Deploy legal teams to challenge Democratic redistricting efforts in states like California and New York, focusing on any procedural or constitutional vulnerabilities.\n3. Monitor judicial actions closely, particularly in states like Utah, and prepare to file appeals or seek legislative remedies where necessary.\n4. Increase intelligence operations to anticipate Democratic strategies and counter them proactively.\n5. Coordinate with federal poll watchers in key states to ensure compliance with voting regulations and prevent any attempts at voter manipulation during the redistricting process.",
