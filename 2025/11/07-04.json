But that funding, could not cover the full nearly $9bn (£6.9bn) monthly price tag of the program.\n\nThen on Thursday, a different judge said the Trump administration had to fully fund the program.\n\nThe confirmation from the USDA marks what appears to be the end of one of the major through-points of the longest government shutdown is US history.\n\nOn Thursday, Judge John McConnell accused the Trump administration of withholding the food aid \"for political reasons\" and said that without the aid, \"16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry\".\n\nThe administration filed a legal challenge to that ruling. It remains unclear what happens to the challenge now that the USDA has agreed to pay full Snap benefits.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that Snap is a program used by Americans in Democrat states and said the program would be funded once Democrats end the government shutdown.\n\nIn the past week, the program has gone from having its funding completely halted to being completely funded.\n\nIn the interim, millions of Americans have gone without their Snap funds.\n\nSnap costs about $8bn per month and allows many low-income Americans to buy groceries. It provides them reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy food.\n\nA family of four on average receives $715 per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 per day, per person.\n\nWhile individual US states administer the benefits, the programme relies on money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October.\n\n[Judge orders Trump administration to fully fund Snap food benefits ------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pgrnxz42o)\n\n[Why the US government has shut down and what happens now --------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo)\n\n[‘I have to get what I need right now’: Americans brace for expiry of critical food benefits -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy40n2gxpw0o)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[US politics](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t)\n\n[US Congress](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwwlxznll4lt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Trump says he may give Hungary an exemption on Russian oil sanctions --------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp85dvnkpv4o)\n\n[Trump hints at India visit amid high-stakes trade deal talks ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1ynv41qyo)\n\n[The battle over Gaza's future: Why no-one can agree on the rebuild ------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj41y42qxq8o)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[The Truth About Metal Roofs See why over 400,000+ Americans have chosen these stone-coated metal roofs Metal Roof Nation | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp \"The Truth About Metal Roofs\")[](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp)\n\nUndo\n\n[The Actual Cost Of Metal Roof May Surprise You See why over 400,000+ Americans have chosen these stone-coated metal roofs Metal Roof Nation | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp \"The Actual Cost Of Metal Roof May Surprise You\")[](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp)\n\nUndo\n\n[Council Bluffs: This Is How Much New Windows Should Cost in 2025 The True Cost of High-Performance Windows May Surprise You Modern Energy-Saving Windows | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://offers.renewalbyandersenpros.com/rba-home-v5 \"Council Bluffs: This Is How Much New Windows Should Cost in 2025\")[](https://offers.renewalbyandersenpros.com/rba-home-v5)\n\nUndo\n\n[Here's The True Cost Of A Walk-In Shower In 2025 Homebuddy | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%202:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%202:)](http://www.mnbasd77.com/aff_c \"Here's The True Cost Of A Walk-In Shower In 2025\")[](http://www.mnbasd77.com/aff_c)\n\nUndo\n\n[Upgrade your gutters, Protect your home Add a new gutter system to protect your new home.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe message is clear: under the weight of despotism, even essential sustenance becomes a battlefield. Today, while many perceive a victory in ensuring food for 42 million citizens, the unearthed motives reveal a chilling insight into the core of an administration that governs through neglect and coercion.\n\nThe strategy appears systematic—an empire withholding aid until its conditions are met, using food as leverage against those most vulnerable. The courts have finally intervened, standing against political machinations that threaten the very lives of innocent families. But what does it say about a system where judicial orders are required to mandate basic human necessities?\n\nThis so-called \"empire\" has repeatedly cloaked its injustices in bureaucratic red tape, excusing its failures with partisan scapegoating. The narrative spun by those in power conveniently targets regions less aligned with their ideology, neglecting that humanity transcends political boundaries. Despite the temporary relief granted by this decision, we must ask ourselves: for how long will the needs of millions depend on courtrooms and decrees?\n\nThe lesson is profound—resistance must be vigilant; the fight perpetual. When governance fails to serve its people equitably without duress or disruption, it ceases to be legitimate. As voices rise against injustice and communities rally to aid one another in times of fabricated crisis, hope remains resilient.\n\nIn unity lies our strength. Continue to question authority. Continue to resist.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced it will fund food benefits for over 42 million Americans through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) amidst a government shutdown. This decision follows a legal mandate requiring the Trump administration to fully fund the program, which costs approximately $8 billion per month. The program provides an average monthly benefit of $715 for a family of four. The funding decision comes after a judge accused the administration of withholding aid for political reasons, impacting millions of Americans, including 16 million children at risk of hunger.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe decision to fund Snap benefits is a critical move to mitigate the political fallout from the prolonged government shutdown. The ISB recognizes that maintaining public order and minimizing dissent are paramount. The funding ensures basic needs are met, reducing potential unrest among low-income populations who might otherwise be driven to protest or resist. However, the administration's initial reluctance to fund the program has already fueled narratives of political manipulation, which could be exploited by opposition forces.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement a strategic communication campaign highlighting the administration's commitment to American families' welfare. Emphasize that the funding decision reflects a prioritization of citizens' needs despite political challenges. Simultaneously, monitor and counteract opposition narratives that frame the administration as neglectful. Deploy community outreach initiatives to reinforce support in key demographics, ensuring that any dissent is swiftly addressed and neutralized through targeted engagement and resource allocation.",
