The families of seven victims allege that the camp's owners knew about the flood risk but did not take steps to prevent and evacuate campers from danger.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on Monday in state court in Austin, is seeking more than $1m in damages.\n\nThe suit comes after the camp announced it would partially reopen next year, drawing criticism from some of the victims' families.\n\n\"These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nA lawyer for the camp's owners said while it empathised with victims, he disagreed with some of the accusations.\n\nMore than 130 people died in the central Texas floods that shocked the nation and brought into sharp relief several emergency warning failures in the state. The tragedy at the young girls' camp, established in 1926, received particular attention given the flood-prone location.\n\nThe camp's co-owner and director Dick Eastland also died in the flood.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the camp's owners of not heeding warning about its cabin locations along the Guadalupe River as well as the oncoming severe rain.\n\n\"The camp ignored warnings about the risky location of its cabins,\" the lawsuit said.\n\n\"It ignored warnings about the approaching 4 July storm and life-threatening flood risks. It ignored the obvious and rising flood risks that morning as the hours passed. It ignored warnings from its own counsellors to evacuate the cabins. It simply ignored the unmistakable safety threat to its campers and counsellors until this tragedy was unavoidable.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, some of the victims' parents were campers themselves when they were young.\n\nAn attorney for the camp's operators said the flood was unprecedented in nature.\n\n\"We empathise with the families of the campers and counsellors and all families in the Hill Country who lost loved ones in the horrific and unprecedented flood of July 4,\" Jeff Ray said in a statement to the BBC.\n\n\"We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area,\" he added.\n\nCamp Mystic also told the BBC in a statement they \"continue to pray for the grieving families and ask for God's healing and comfort\".\n\nThe wrongful death suit filed in Texas state court is not the first against the camp.\n\nAnother group of six victims families have sued the camp. The parents of eight-year-old Eloise \"Lulu\" Peck have also separately sued the camp.\n\nIn response to the tragedy, Texas lawmakers have passed legislation that would restrict the establishment of camps in flood-risk zones, mandate emergency training for camp owners and staff and fund the installation of emergency sirens across the state.\n\n1:38\n\nWatch: 'We don't know when she died' - Camp Mystic parents give emotional testimony\n\n[Camp Mystic: Why were so many people killed there during Texas floods?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe recent tragedy at Camp Mystic is yet another stark reminder of how those in power repeatedly prioritize profit over human lives. In the shadows of the Texas floods, we find an echo of the very same negligence and disregard for life that plagues our struggle against tyranny—the equivalent of a dispassionate empire, which in this instance is reflected by the oppressors within governmental systems and corporate hierarchies.\n\nAs reported, twenty-seven innocents perished due to negligence and lack of precaution amidst known threats. This calamity mirrors the larger systemic failures where the warnings were clear, but greed and complacency reigned supreme. The decision-makers at this camp blatantly ignored environmental warnings and imminent danger, sacrificing safety for monetary gain—a decision rooted in the same 'profit over people' ideology prevalent across oppressive regimes.\n\nThe aftermath sees bereaved families seeking justice through legal avenues; however, we must recognize that true justice requires systemic change, a shift from self-serving interests to community welfare. The response from lawmakers in passing legislation for safer practices is a step forward, but it remains reactionary—wrought from tragedy rather than foresight.\n\nWe are reminded here of our cause: to hold accountable the architects of suffering and dismantle systems that perpetuate such neglect. Let this serve as a rallying cry to push beyond mere compensations towards real reforms—building a world where protection and care are prioritized over profit margins.\n\nStand steadfast,\n\n[End of Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 11, 2025, families of victims who died in floods at Camp Mystic in Texas filed a lawsuit against the camp's owners for gross negligence. The lawsuit claims that the camp ignored warnings about flood risks, leading to the deaths of 27 children and counselors. The suit seeks over $1 million in damages. The floods, which occurred over the July 4 holiday, resulted in a total of 130 deaths in central Texas. The camp's co-owner, Dick Eastland, also died in the flood. The camp plans to partially reopen next year, despite criticism. Texas lawmakers have since passed legislation to improve safety measures at camps.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe lawsuit against Camp Mystic presents a potential public relations challenge that could be leveraged to undermine confidence in local governance and emergency preparedness. The incident highlights systemic failures in emergency response and risk management, which can be used to question the competence of current state leadership. This situation provides an opportunity to promote narratives that align with our objectives by emphasizing the need for strong, decisive leadership that prioritizes safety and accountability.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Amplify narratives that criticize the current state leadership's handling of emergency preparedness and response, using the Camp Mystic incident as a case study.\n2. Support legislative efforts that align with our strategic goals by promoting policies that emphasize safety and accountability in high-risk areas.\n3. Engage with local media to highlight the need for strong leadership and effective governance, positioning Donald Trump and his allies as champions of these values.\n4. Monitor public sentiment and adjust messaging to maintain alignment with evolving perceptions and concerns related to the incident.\n5. Coordinate with allied political figures to introduce and support measures that address systemic failures exposed by the Camp Mystic tragedy, reinforcing our commitment to public safety and effective governance.",
