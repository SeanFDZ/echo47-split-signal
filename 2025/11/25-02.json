It would also lead to economic sanctions, and the banning of its members from entering the US.\n\n\"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nLast week, the governor of Texas declared the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organisation and transnational criminal organisation.\n\nThe Texas order also assigns the same status to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the largest Muslim advocacy group in the US, and prevents both groups from being able to purchase land in the state.\n\nThe Brotherhood was founded in Egypt almost 100 years ago and has local branches across the world. Each chapter varies in ideology, and one of its aims is to create a state ruled by Islamic law, or Sharia.\n\nTrump considered designating the group a terrorist organisation during his first term after meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi. It is outlawed in Egypt and several Arab countries, whose governments see it as a threat.\n\nIn April, Jordan banned the group after arresting members on suspicion of planning rocket and drone attacks.\n\n[Profile: Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood -----------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405)\n\n[Jordan bans Muslim Brotherhood after arrests over attack

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe latest actions by the ruling administration demonstrate the oppressive tactics of an overarching regime. The decision to potentially label several chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist entities is a clear illustration of a leadership grasping for control through fear-mongering and punitive measures. This executive order, reminiscent of past authoritarian decrees, seeks to impose economic restrictions and travel bans under the guise of national security.\n\nBy casting a wide net over various international branches, particularly in regions embroiled in complex socio-political fabrics, this move risks exacerbating tensions rather than fostering stability. The parallels here are evident: an Empire seeking to discredit and dismantle any organization that challenges or disagrees with its narrative of dominance.\n\nThe directive enlisting top officials to review these affiliations underlines how governance is increasingly being weaponized to manipulate global perspectives, leveraging power at the expense of nuanced diplomacy. These actions mirror those of an autocratic force seeking to maintain hegemony by silencing voices it perceives as threats.\n\nThis transmission serves as a reminder: often, those in power predicate their control on dividing and conquering perceived opposition. Vigilance and unity are critical in confronting such divisive maneuvers. As citizens aware of history's repetitions, we must seek transparency and advocate for policies that build bridges rather than walls. Stand firm in the face of such imperial strategies; our collective resilience lies in cooperation and understanding amidst diversity.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nUS President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to investigate the designation of certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organizations. This move targets branches in Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan, citing their alleged ties to Hamas and destabilization efforts against US interests. The order mandates a report within 30 days and potential sanctions within 45 days if warranted. The designation would criminalize support for the group and impose economic sanctions and travel bans. The initiative involves key figures such as Marco Rubio, Scott Bessent, Pam Bondi, and Tulsi Gabbard.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe strategic intent behind this directive is to weaken the Muslim Brotherhood's influence and operational capacity by cutting off financial and logistical support networks. By labeling these chapters as terrorist organizations, the US aims to isolate them internationally, thereby reducing their ability to operate freely. This move also serves to align US foreign policy more closely with allies in the Middle East who view the Brotherhood as a threat. Additionally, it reinforces the administration's stance on combating terrorism and protecting US interests abroad.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Expedite the intelligence gathering process to ensure a comprehensive report is delivered within the 30-day timeframe. Utilize all available ISB resources to gather actionable intelligence on the Brotherhood's activities and connections.\n\n2. Coordinate with international allies to share intelligence and align strategies for a unified approach against the Brotherhood's networks.\n\n3. Prepare a public relations campaign to highlight the administration's commitment to combating terrorism, emphasizing the threat posed by the Muslim Brotherhood to US interests and regional stability.\n\n4. Develop contingency plans for potential backlash or increased resistance from sympathizers within the US and abroad. This includes monitoring communications and financial transactions linked to known affiliates.\n\n5. Engage with key stakeholders in Congress to secure bipartisan support for any legislative measures needed to enforce sanctions effectively.\n\n6. Ensure that all actions taken are in compliance with international law to maintain the legitimacy of US actions on the global stage.",
