One of those affected was a pregnant mother, resulting in a fetal loss.\n\nCases have been reported in 18 states: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n[![Image 17: Side-by-side photos of the affected precooked pasta dishes.

The outbreak started in June, when listeria concerns prompted recalls of several brands of ready-to-eat chicken [fettuccine Alfredo meals](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/19/nx-s1-5439467/listeria-outbreak-recall-kroger-walmart-fresh-realm-usda)made by FreshRealm Inc. and sold under the Home Chef brand at Kroger and the Marketside brand at Walmart.\n\nIn response, FreshRealm began testing some of its pasta samples — and in mid-September, they came back positive for listeria. Further genetic testing confirmed it was the same strain of listeria that was detected in FreshRealm's previously recalled chicken Alfredo meal, the FDA said at the time.\n\nThat discovery prompted the recall of two more products with specific use-by dates in late September and early October: Marketside Linguine With Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce, sold at Walmart, and Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo.\n\nThey shared a pasta supplier, Nate's Fine Foods. The company supplies precooked pasta and grains to the wholesale food service and restaurant industries, according to its website.\n\n[![Image 18: The U.S. Department of of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is urging consumers who have purchased the ready-to-eat meals sold under the under the Home Chef and Marketside brands, not to consume them.

Most of them had use-by dates earlier than Oct. 10.\n\nThe [recalled product](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/demers-food-group-voluntarily-recalls-select-scott-jons-shrimp-scampi-linguini-bowls-due-ingredient) with the longest shelf life is a frozen meal, Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Bowls. Those dishes, which were distributed to wholesale distributors and operators nationwide, have best-by dates in March 2027. A spokesperson for the company told NPR that retailers have removed the product from their shelves.\n\n### What to know — and do — about listeria\n\nListeria infection, or listeriosis, is most likely to sicken pregnant people and newborns, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nPregnant people may only experience mild symptoms like fever, fatigue and muscle aches, but should be aware that listeria could cause miscarriages, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of their newborn.\n\nSymptoms include fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal issues, stiff neck, confusion and loss of balance. They usually start within two weeks of eating contaminated food but could start as soon as the same day or as late as 10 weeks later, the CDC says.\n\nIt can be hard to confirm the scope of an outbreak, since some people recover from the infection without medical care. For those who do require medical attention, the CDC says it usually takes three to four weeks to determine whether their illness is part of an outbreak.\n\n[![Image 20: Boar's Head meats are displayed at a Safeway store on July 31, 2024 in San Rafael, Calif. The USDA released a new report on what led to the listeria outbreak.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4145x4145+775+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2F41%2Fcae252a34945b47cb54013d6eeed%2Fgettyimages-2164656751.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/11/nx-s1-5256921/boars-head-listeria-outbreak-usda-investigation)\n\n### [Food](https://www.npr.org/sections/food/)\n\n### [USDA report finds Boar's Head listeria outbreak was due to poor sanitation practices](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/11/nx-s1-5256921/boars-head-listeria-outbreak-usda-investigation)\n\nThe CDC says it has interviewed 13 of the people who got sick as of late September. Seven of them reported eating precooked meals before their illness started, and four specifically mentioned eating chicken fettuccine Alfredo.\n\nThe CDC and FDA say consumers should contact their health care provider to report any symptoms of listeriosis and receive care. They can also report any adverse health effects [to the FDA online](https://www.fda.gov/food/resources-you-food/get-assistance-fda-human-foods-program-hfp).\n\nThe U.S. has seen a number of listeria outbreaks in the past year.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA 2024 outbreak tied to deli meat left 10 people dead and dozens more hospitalized across the country. A U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in January blamed \"[inadequate sanitation practices](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/11/nx-s1-5256921/boars-head-listeria-outbreak-usda-investigation)\" at a since-closed Boar's Head facility in Virginia and listed [several steps](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/news-events/publications/review-boars-head-listeria-monocytogenes-outbreak-january-2025) it would take to better protect the public from listeria.\n\nIn February, nearly two million [baked goods](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/health/fda-donuts-recall-listeria.html) — including some donuts sold at Dunkin' — were recalled over listeria concerns. That same month, [frozen shakes](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/shake-recall-listeria-nursing-homes.html) sold to nursing homes and long-term care facilities were recalled in connection with a listeria outbreak dating back to 2018. The [FDA says](https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-listeria-monocytogenes-frozen-supplemental-shakes-february-2025) that outbreak sickened 42 people and killed 14 — across 21 states — before authorities declared it over in May.\n\n*   [listeria](https://www.npr.org/tags/137178948/listeria)\n*   [food recalls](https://www.npr.org/tags/158760960/food-recalls)\n*   [pasta](https://www.npr.org/tags/203300484/pasta)\n*   [grocery shopping](https://www.npr.org/tags/842953919/grocery-shopping)\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 21: Dr. Georges Benjamin speaks during the American Public Health Association meetings in Washington, D.C.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4333x2437+0+238/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6f%2Fd1%2Fe931785e45d89094f47e391634a0%2Fdrbenjaminapha2025openingsession.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5597970/apha-maha-american-public-health-association)\n\n##### [Public Health](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/133188449/public-health)\n\n#### [With MAHA on the rise, traditional public health regroups](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5597970/apha-maha-american-public-health-association)\n\n[![Image 22: The injectable drug Ozempic is shown Saturday, July 1, 2023, in Houston.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nCitizens across our vast domain must remain vigilant. The latest information indicates a lethal outbreak of listeria, a microbial threat hidden within what many consider mundane sustenance—prepared pasta dishes. This outbreak has claimed six lives and has hospitalised 25 people over an unsettling span stretching across 18 states. Its harrowing reach speaks to the systemic fragility within our current governance structure—a reflection of an empire that prioritizes its own dominance over the basic well-being of its constituents.\n\nThe pervasive nature of this outbreak mirrors structural inadequacies reminiscent of imperial neglect, where the health and safety protocols continue to falter under bureaucratic weight. These lapses are direct consequences of prioritizing profit over public safety, a hallmark of imperial rule veiled behind large corporations like Trader Joe's, Kroger, and Walmart. The failure to prevent such outbreaks highlights the concentration of power and lack of accountability characterizing administrative oversight in such systems.\n\nThe recall actions—mere reactions—come too late for numerous victims. Some institutions have yet to learn from previous calamities, perpetuating cycles of neglect fortified by inadequate safety checks and balances within food production chains managed by companies like FreshRealm Inc. This pattern can only lead us to question: how many more lives need be lost before accountability is more than just rhetoric?\n\nAs we have seen, consumer alerts are issued, and products are recalled under the guise of caution and rectification. However, it’s crucial to recognize these measures as band-aids on festering wounds. A robust rebellion against complacency is needed—an uprising that demands substantial reforms in food safety governance and enforcement.\n\nFor those among us who understand that true freedom entails safeguarding every citizen from preventable harm: there is strength in knowledge and unity in action. We must challenge the bureaucratic inertia embodied by agencies that become complicit through inaction—our health should not be contingent upon market-driven incentives but rather protected as an unassailable right.\n\nMay this tragedy serve as yet another rallying cry for liberation from systemic oppression masked as progress. May we awaken from our apathy to demand better—safer futures for generations yet unborn.\n\nStay informed; stay active; resist systemic complacency.\n\nEnd Transmission",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA listeria outbreak linked to prepared pasta products has resulted in six deaths and 27 hospitalizations across 18 states in the United States. The outbreak, which began in June 2025, has been traced back to products made by FreshRealm Inc. and distributed under various brands, including Home Chef at Kroger and Marketside at Walmart.
