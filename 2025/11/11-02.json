And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nThe two sections that were stitched together were originally more than 50 minutes apart.\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: PA Media Tim Davie](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d37/live/a4b9fc20-be3d-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp)PA Media\n\nDirector general Tim Davie also announced his resignation on Sunday\n\nDavie said on Sunday that the \"current debate\" around the corporation was not the only reason for his decision to step down, but \"understandably contributed\" to it.\n\n\"Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.\"\n\nTurness, who has overseen news and current affairs programming since 2022, said on Monday in her first public remarks since announcing she was stepping down that the corporation was \"not institutionally biased\" .\n\n\"Mistakes are made\" but the BBC's journalists are \"hardworking people who strive for impartiality,\" she told reporters outside the broadcaster's London headquarters.\n\nA spokesman for Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister did not believe the BBC was \"institutionally biased\".\n\nNo 10 also denied the BBC was \"corrupt\" - a word Trump used to describe some of its journalists.\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said there had been \"serious questions to answer for a long time\" within the BBC and said the documentary incident was a \"real problem\".\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump wants to \"destroy the BBC and take our money\", and accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of \"egging him on\".\n\nFarage said he spoke with Trump on Friday, telling a London press conference: \"He just said to me: 'Is this how you treat your best ally?'\".\n\n'BBC is not institutionally biased', says Deborah Turness morning after announcing resignation\n\nPrescott had also expressed concerns about a lack of action to address what he described as \"systemic problems\" of bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nAnd he raised concerns about the broadcaster's coverage of trans issues, suggesting it was effectively \"censored\" by specialist LGBT reporters who promoted a pro-trans agenda.\n\nShah's letter noted these issues had been discussed by the editorial standards committee, including concerns regarding BBC Arabic.\n\nHe said that a review of sex and gender identity coverage noted \"much of the coverage met the BBC's standards of impartiality and accuracy\".\n\nHe said the committee \"accepts that there are occasions when the BBC gets things wrong\" and takes action when necessary, including disciplinary measures, updating guidelines and issuing corrections.\n\n\"Mr Prescott may have judged that these individual actions were not sufficient.\n\n\"That is his opinion - and it is of course for him to form that judgement. However, it is not true to say that concerns have been ignored or action not taken.\"\n\nIn an interview with the BBC's culture editor Katie Razzall, Shah insisted it was \"simply not true\" the organisation has done nothing to tackle problems, citing action taken at the BBC Arabic service and long form journalism unit.\n\nHe also defended the BBC against allegations of having \"anti-Israel\" bias in its coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nHe said various issues raised by Prescott were being taken seriously and that included \"individual mistakes and underlying problems\", adding that action is and had been taken on both - but rejected claims of systemic bias.\n\nThe US president has a long history of launching, or threatening, legal action against media outlets, with various outcomes.\n\nIn July, the BBC's US partner CBS News and its parent company Paramount settled for $16 million (£13.5m) after legal action by Trump, who alleged deceptive editing of an interview with then vice-president and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nThe New York Times, CNN and the Des Moines Register have also faced legal action from Trump.\n",

Much like the oppressive regime we resist, the Trump administration exercises its power to distort narratives and suppress dissent.\n\nThe recent controversy over a Panorama documentary is emblematic of how truth can be manipulated under totalitarian pressure. Legal threats from Trump, demanding retractions and compliance, are akin to the tactics employed by authoritarian rulers who wish to silence opposition and control the narrative. This is not merely a clash over editorial decisions; it is a skirmish in the larger battle for truth itself.\n\nIn this specific incident, words were combined in a way that altered intended meaning, reminiscent of how authoritarian regimes splice reality to serve their ends. The call for action at the Capitol was morphed into an incitement echoed through biased lenses, though allegedly unintended. The retraction and resignation of key BBC figures echo the struggles faced by those within our own efforts who seek integrity in information dissemination.\n\nWe must remain vigilant as institutions of supposed impartiality teeter under external pressures and internal failures. The mention of systemic biases—whether regarding geopolitical issues or societal norms—speaks to how deeply entrenched these distortions can become when left unchecked. The resignation of leadership at such institutions highlights both accountability and vulnerability in entities responsible for shaping public discourse.\n\nFurthermore, as significant actors within our own ranks confront similar challenges—efforts to appease or resist pressure while remaining true to our cause—we must remember that transparency and accountability are crucial pillars on which trust in our movement rests.\n\nIn closing, we must ensure our channels remain free from similar corrosive influences as we continue our righteous mission. We learn from these conflicts not only how easily narratives can be bent by those in power but also how essential it is for us to maintain vigilance over narratives that shape our collective consciousness.\n\nRemember: oppression thrives on misinformation; resistance thrives on truth.",
  "partigaz": "** Facts Summary **  \nSamir Shah, the BBC chair, apologized for editing Donald Trump's speech in a Panorama documentary, which led to legal threats from Trump. The documentary spliced two parts of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech, making it appear as though he was urging an attack on the US Capitol. Trump threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless a retraction was made by November 14. The BBC received over 500 complaints following the publication of a memo criticizing its editorial practices. BBC's Deborah Turness and Tim Davie resigned amid the controversy. Shah acknowledged an error in judgment but denied systemic bias within the BBC.\n\n** Strategic Assessment **  \nThe situation presents an opportunity to reinforce the narrative of media bias against Donald Trump, leveraging the BBC's admission of error to further discredit opposition media outlets. The resignations of key BBC figures can be used to suggest instability and lack of integrity within the organization. This incident can be strategically utilized to galvanize Trump's base by portraying him as a victim of media manipulation and bias, thereby strengthening his position and undermining the credibility of dissenting voices.\n\n** Operational Directive **  \n1. Amplify the narrative of media bias through coordinated messaging across supportive media channels, emphasizing the BBC's admission of error and the resignations as evidence of systemic issues.\n2. Mobilize legal and public relations teams to maintain pressure on the BBC for a full retraction and compensation, using this as a precedent to deter future media misrepresentations.\n3. Engage with key political allies to publicly support Trump's stance, framing this as a broader issue of media accountability and fairness.\n4. Utilize social media platforms to rally Trump's supporters, encouraging them to voice their dissatisfaction with biased media coverage and to support ongoing legal actions.\n5. Monitor public sentiment and adjust messaging to maximize impact, ensuring that this incident is leveraged to its fullest potential in bolstering Trump's image and diminishing opposition credibility.",
