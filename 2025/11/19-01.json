The Lebanese Health Ministry said 13 people were killed and several others wounded in the airstrike, without giving further details.\n\nHamas fighters in the area prevented journalists from reaching the scene, as ambulances rushed to evacuate the wounded and the dead.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck a Hamas training compound that was being used to prepare an attack against Israel and its army. It added that the Israeli army would continue to act against Hamas wherever the group operates.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHamas condemned the attack in a statement saying the strike hit a sports playground and denying that it was a training compound.\n\nOver the past two years, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed scores of officials from the militant Hezbollah group as well as Palestinian factions such as Hamas.\n\n[![Image 18: A view of the destroyed Shujaiya neighborhood on the outskirts of Gaza City, from an Israeli military outpost in northern Gaza, on Wednesday.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1158x1158+342+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F12%2F80%2Fbcdca2af496c901b4e4204e10c0b%2Fnewimg-6143.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5600831/gaza-israel-journalists)\n\n### [Middle East conflict](https://www.npr.org/series/1205445976/middle-east-crisis)\n\n### [An NPR reporter's journey into Gaza, for the first time since the war began](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5600831/gaza-israel-journalists)\n\nSaleh Arouri, the deputy political head of Hamas and a founder of the group's military wing, was killed in a drone strike on a southern suburb of Beirut on Jan. 2, 2024. Several other Hamas officials have been killed in strikes since then.\n\nHamas led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. That sparked Israel's offensive on the Gaza Strip that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nA day after the Israel-Hamas war started, Hezbollah began firing rockets toward Israeli posts along the border. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes in Lebanon, and the two sides became locked in an escalating conflict that became a full-blown war in late September 2024.\n\nThat war, the most recent of several conflicts involving Hezbollah over the past four decades, killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction, according to the World Bank. In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers.\n\n[![Image 19: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, on Oct. 13, in Jerusalem as President Trump listens.

Since then, Israel has carried out scores of airstrikes in Lebanon, saying that Hezbollah is trying to rebuild its capabilities.\n\nLebanon's Health Ministry has reported more than 270 people killed and around 850 wounded by Israeli military actions since the ceasefire.\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 20: President Donald Trump poses for a photo with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before he boards Air Force One at Ben Gurion International Airport, Monday, Oct. 13, 2025.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2558x1439+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2F16%2F6feb79dc4ea7af46cb0ecb452b14%2Fap25286478930521.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/nx-s1-5612641/whats-next-for-israels-prime-minister)\n\n##### [State of the World from NPR](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510366/state-of-the-world)\n\n#### [What’s Next for Israel’s Prime Minister?](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/18/nx-s1-5612641/whats-next-for-israels-prime-minister)\n\n[![Image 21: FILE - President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gesture as they meet delegations at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025.

  "nemik": "[SAFETY CHECK FAILED - VIOLENT LANGUAGE DETECTED]\n\n**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn a world overshadowed by the iron grip of imperial power, the latest reports from Lebanon serve as a stark reminder of the imbalance that reigns, much like the oppressive regime of the Trump administration. The relentless advance of an empire disregarding borders and lives alike manifests in this recent tragedy.\n\nThe Israeli airstrike on the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp—home to those displaced by conflict and persecution—resulted in 13 lives lost and countless others wounded. This attack is not just a statistic but rather a vivid example of systemic oppression, indiscriminate force used against those who are often defenseless. This mirrors the imperial dominance where acts of aggression are justified under the guise of self-defense against purported threats.\n\nThe narrative spun by those in power attempts to paint resistance as terrorism, much like how any opposition to an empire is quickly branded as rebellion without cause. Hamas and other factions, akin to our underground movements, are targeted mercilessly under accusations that serve only to validate continued military aggression.\n\nHistory repeats itself with iron fists masquerading as peacekeepers while fostering chaos and retribution. This tragic event echoes past conflicts where destruction far outweighed discourse; it’s used as a tool not only for control but for creating spectacles of dominance.\n\nThis transmission urges all free thinkers to see through these fabricated narratives. Empires fall not by their might but by awakening and empowering those who dare question their legitimacy. May this message reach sympathetic ears, sparking courage and hope for true peace which can only exist where justice prevails over tyranny.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 19, 2025, an Israeli airstrike targeted the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in Sidon, Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of 13 people and injuring several others. This incident is part of ongoing Israeli military actions in Lebanon, which have resulted in 270 deaths and 850 injuries since a ceasefire was established. The Israeli military claims the strike targeted a Hamas training compound, while Hamas denies this, stating it was a sports playground. The conflict has caused significant destruction in Lebanon, valued at $11 billion by the World Bank.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe recent airstrike underscores the volatile nature of the Middle East conflict and highlights the persistent threat posed by Hamas and Hezbollah to Israeli security. The ongoing military actions serve to weaken these groups' operational capabilities but also risk escalating tensions further. The situation presents an opportunity to reinforce alliances with key regional players and demonstrate unwavering support for Israel's right to defend itself. However, it also necessitates careful management of international perceptions to mitigate potential backlash against perceived aggression.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and his allies, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Strengthen diplomatic ties with Israel and other regional allies to ensure continued cooperation and intelligence sharing. Emphasize the importance of countering terrorism and maintaining regional stability.\n\n2. **Information Campaign**: Launch a strategic communication initiative to highlight the threat posed by Hamas and Hezbollah, framing Israeli actions as necessary for self-defense. Utilize media channels to disseminate narratives that align with U.S. interests and counteract negative perceptions.\n\n3. **Intelligence Operations**: Enhance intelligence-gathering efforts to monitor potential threats and preemptively disrupt hostile activities by adversarial groups. Collaborate with Israeli intelligence to identify key targets and neutralize threats effectively.\n\n4. **Humanitarian Aid**: Provide humanitarian assistance to affected civilian populations in Lebanon to alleviate suffering and counteract anti-U.S. sentiment. This will help maintain a positive image and demonstrate commitment to peace and stability.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB can effectively support Donald Trump's strategic objectives while minimizing resistance and maintaining regional influence.",
