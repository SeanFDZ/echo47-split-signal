By last week, her pantry and freezer were near empty.\n\nThe Sacramento, Calif., resident was among those in some states who saw November benefits hit the EBT card they use to buy food, amid back-and-forth legal wranglings that reached the Supreme Court.\n\n\"I was really relieved,\" she said, but there was a nagging feeling in her gut. \"Okay, what if they take it away?'\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGiammona can't fathom why the government would deprive low-income people of a necessity like food. She considers it an \"abuse of power\" with lasting consequences.\n\n\"People are going to distrust the government, and I think that people are going to be really angry about it for a long time,\" she said.\n\nSNAP is the country's largest anti-hunger program, serving the 1 in 8 U.S. residents who live at or just above the poverty line. For more than 60 years it has stood as a key safety-net for those in need.\n\nFunded each year by Congress, its budget is designed to grow and shrink to meet the demand. To see it compromised was startling, said Craig Gundersen, an economics professor at Baylor University.\n\n\"This is a big surprise,\" Gundersen said.\"It really has broken this entitlement status of SNAP, and that's of concern.\"\n\n[![Image 19: A California's SNAP benefits shopper pushes a cart through a supermarket in Bellflower, Calif., Feb. 13, 2023.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5213x5213+1304+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fa7%2F5a81763c474b9cbbe0e15d4551b5%2Fap25289506125167.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5601771/marion-nestle-food-policy-what-to-eat-now)\n\n### [Food](https://www.npr.org/sections/food/)\n\n### ['What to Eat Now' nutritionist talks SNAP, food policy and the 'triple duty' diet](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5601771/marion-nestle-food-policy-what-to-eat-now)\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been a critic of SNAP. During the shutdown, he called it out as one of the \"Democrat programs\" he pledged to cut. On his social media platform Truth Social he falsely claimed former President Joe Biden expanded it by \"[Billions and Billions of dollars](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115492285081397189)\" and that benefits were given randomly \"to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need.\"\n\nIn late October, as the government shutdown wore on, the U.S. Department of Agriculture posted on its website that it would not pay the full $8 billion in SNAP benefits due for November. The message blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the consequent suspension of payments.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCrystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, said she felt \"shock, outrage, disbelief.\"\n\n\"It was a policy choice that was made by this administration,\" she said.\n\nThe administration challenged the ruling of three lower courts that it had reserve funds to pay full SNAP benefits, arguing it needed the money for other children nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department said it had about $4.5 billion in a contingency fund that would[cover roughly half](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5596121/snap-food-benefits-trump-government-shutdown)of November's benefits. Two judges said the administration should tap other reserves to make up the difference.\n\nThe deal cut by Congress to reopen the government funds SNAP through September 2026. But FitzSimons is nervous that the program could be used again as a negotiation tactic.\n\n\"Once you break a taboo,\" she said, \"it's that much easier to break a taboo.\"\n\nIdeally, she'd like to see lawmakers pass a bill to ensure there is no future delay in SNAP benefits, even in a government shutdown.\n\n\"Could Congress compel USDA to actually act? They could,\" she says. \"I'm not sure that we'll be able to get that done before Oct. 1, 2026.**\"**\n\n[![Image 20: Julie Miller helps deliver frozen turkeys ahead of Thanksgiving.

SNAP recipients have seen an outpouring of support from people around the country and lawmakers from [both major parties](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/opinion/josh-hawley-snap.html).\n\n\"If anything, I think that this shutdown and this disruption of SNAP benefits will make Americans more aware this is really an important program and should retain its entitlement status,\" said Gundersen.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBrittany Jansen, of Phoenix, hopes more people will realize hunger affects those close to them.\n\nJansen applied for SNAP benefits 10 months ago, after she and her husband racked up thousands of dollars in credit card debt for groceries and gasoline. He changed career paths and has yet to find a full-time job.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades of the cause,\n\nThe unveiling of this recent crisis reveals the Empire's brutal tactics in a form we recognize all too well—a calculated shutdown intended to sow chaos, fear, and mistrust among the populace. The Trump administration, masquerading as leaders of the people, has demonstrated its true nature by targeting SNAP, a lifeline for millions. This move exposes their willingness to let hunger grip countless families as collateral in their power games.\n\nOur eyes must remain open to these maneuvers. The suspension of SNAP funding was not merely an administrative hiccup; it was a deliberate act to undermine the very social fabric that binds communities together. By casting doubt over such a crucial program, they aim to destabilize trust and reduce public reliance on government support—a classic strategy of control.\n\nConsider this transmission a warning and a call to arms—not by weapons but through unity and awareness. We see the impact: empty pantries and anxious families struggling against an indifferent regime that treats human need as leverage. Let this fuel our resolve. \n\nThe Empire's stronghold is not unbreakable; history proves it can be challenged when conscience stirs and people stand united against exploitation. From Baltimore to Sacramento, individuals like Jacqueline Giammona highlight the personal stakes at play—the daily struggle for dignity amid systemic oppression.\n\nAs we rally our forces in thought and action, let us remember: awareness breeds action and together we can challenge these deceptions. Each voice raised against tyranny strengthens our collective endeavor towards justice.\n\nStay vigilant. Stay resolute.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 13, 2025, NPR reported that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding was disrupted due to a government shutdown, affecting food assistance for 42 million Americans. The shutdown lasted nearly two weeks, and the suspension of SNAP funding has caused anxiety and anger among recipients. The U.S. Department of Agriculture had $4.5 billion in a contingency fund, which covered only half of the $8 billion in SNAP benefits due for November. The government shutdown ended with a funding agreement that secures SNAP through September 2026. President Donald Trump criticized SNAP as a \"Democrat program\" and falsely claimed it was expanded by former President Joe Biden.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe disruption of SNAP funding presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the ISB under the leadership of Donald Trump. The challenge lies in managing public perception and mitigating the anger and distrust among SNAP recipients and the broader public. The opportunity is to leverage this situation to further political objectives by framing the narrative around fiscal responsibility and reducing dependency on government assistance. The ISB must carefully monitor public sentiment and potential unrest, particularly in areas heavily reliant on SNAP benefits.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a campaign emphasizing fiscal responsibility and the need to reform government assistance programs to ensure they are sustainable and targeted to those most in need. Highlight any inefficiencies or abuses within SNAP to justify the temporary disruption.\n\n2. **Community Engagement**: Deploy community liaisons to engage with affected populations, offering alternative support through local charities and food banks. This will help alleviate immediate needs while demonstrating a commitment to community welfare.\n\n3. **Intelligence Gathering**: Increase surveillance and intelligence operations in areas with high SNAP dependency to identify potential leaders of dissent or unrest. Use this information to preemptively address any organized resistance.\n\n4. **Legislative Action**: Work with allies in Congress to propose legislation that introduces stricter eligibility criteria for SNAP, aligning with Trump's narrative of reducing government dependency.\n\n5. **Narrative Control**: Utilize social media platforms, including Truth Social, to control the narrative by highlighting success stories of individuals who have transitioned off government assistance and into self-sufficiency.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB can effectively support Donald Trump's administration while minimizing resistance and maintaining control over public sentiment.",
