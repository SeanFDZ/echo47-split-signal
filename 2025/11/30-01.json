And for pneumonia vaccines, manufacturers will have to prove they reduce disease rather than show they generate antibodies. He also raised questions about giving multiple vaccines at the same time, which is standard practice.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe changes could make it much more difficult and expensive for vaccines to get approved, further limiting the availability of vaccines, which are considered among the safest and most effective tools for protecting people against infectious diseases.\n\nWhile all vaccines carry some risks, most public health experts argue the current process for vetting vaccines before marketing has long assured that the benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks. Studies required after vaccines are approved and surveillance systems, including the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/report-problem-center-biologics-evaluation-research/vaccine-adverse-events) (VAERS), also flag potential safety issues once vaccines are in use.\n\n### FDA says an analysis links COVID shots to some deaths\n\nMakary said on Fox News that 10 children had died from the COVID shot during the Biden administration, but did not offer specifics about how the FDA came to that conclusion. [Millions of children](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/) have received the vaccine.\n\nOfficials with the Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the COVID analysis and changes to vaccine review standards.\n\nAccording to the FDA email from Prasad, he told the agency's biostatistics and pharmacovigilance team to analyze 96 reported deaths from 2021 to 2024, and they determined 10 children died \"after and because of\" the COVID vaccine. But Prasad said the true number was likely higher.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDr. Paul Offit, who [directs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a), said in a text message that Prasad has not shared the evidence that these vaccines killed 10 children.\n\n\"Because he doesn't provide any evidence, he is asking us to trust him on an important issue,\" Office said. \"All this will do is scare people unnecessarily. At the very least, he should provide all the evidence he has so that experts in the field can review it and decide whether he has enough data to prove his point.\"\n\nDr. Jesse Goodman, [a professor at Georgetown University](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TNITAA4/jesse-l-goodman) who held Prasad's job at FDA from 2003 until 2009, said in an email that the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine approval, has been \"recognized globally as a gold standard regulator.\" Goodman defended \"immunologic endpoints like antibody levels\" for the accelerated approval of pneumonia and influenza vaccines. He said science supports their use and they are confirmed with studies after approval: \"These approaches have helped provide children and adults with timely access to safe and effective vaccines, saving many lives.\"\n\n[Michael Osterholm](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/michael-osterholm), an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, reviewed the email from Prasad and challenged his statement that \"COVID-19 was never highly lethal for children.\" Osterholm also questioned the FDA's latest analysis of adverse event reports attributing the 10 deaths to COVID vaccines.\n\n\"Prasad's email is filled with factual mistakes and misrepresents both the severity of COVID in children (1597 deaths in 2020-2022) and how the US responded to the first signals of possible vaccine-associated pediatric deaths in May 2021,\" Osterholm wrote in an email to NPR.\n\n\"While Prasad's email notes 10 such deaths, these cases have never been presented for review by the medical and public health communities or published in the medical literature,\" Osterholm continued. \"Given the record of this Administration to misrepresent scientific data regarding vaccines, until these cases have been reviewed by an expert third party, like the National Academy of Science[s], we can not accept the fact they are vaccine-associated deaths.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n### Surveillance system collects vaccines reports\n\nThe FDA makes public data from the VAERS surveillance system co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But [FDA cautions](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccine-adverse-events/vaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system-vaers-database-information), \"it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause and effect relationship has been established.\" In his email, Prasad wrote that \"with case reports, causality is typically assessed on a subjective scale. In this scale ranging from certain to unlikely -- certain, possible/likely, and probable are broadly considered as related to the product.\"\n\nMakary said on Fox News that when the COVID shot was first rolled out, it was \"amazing\" for people at high risk of coming down with severe disease, but things have changed.\n\n\"Back in 2020, we saw a reduction in the severity of illness and lives saved, but now recommending that a 6-year-old girl get another 70 million COVID shots – one each year for the rest of her life – is not based on science. And so we're not going to just rubber stamp approvals without seeing some scientific evidence.\"\n\n[![Image 20: ACIP member Retsef Levi points to a slide while speaking during a meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on September 18, 2025 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned vaccines.\n\nThe FDA [restricted eligibility](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted) for the updated COVID vaccines in August after announcing the agency planned to [require more evidence](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/20/nx-s1-5405013/fda-covid-vaccine-limits)about the shots' safety and effectiveness going forward.\n\n### CDC committee will meet to review vaccine policies\n\nThe FDA email on vaccine policy comes just before the CDC convenes a crucial [two-day meeting](https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html) of that agency's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Dec. 4-5. The committee is in the process of conducting a major review of how children are inoculated against dangerous infectious diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio and hepatitis B.\n\nMany public health experts are concerned the committee will upend the childhood vaccination schedule. It could move to delay the timing of some inoculations, space out vaccinations and call for the reformulation of some vaccines. Taken together, the moves could result in fewer children getting protected and the resurgence of once-vanquished diseases.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAsked about Makary and Prasad's claims that the COVID vaccine caused deaths among 10 children, Moderna, whose COVID vaccine is approved for children as young as 6 months old, pointed to a [statement it made in September](https://investors.modernatx.com/statement-on-the-safety-of-spikevax). The company says that multiple published, peer-reviewed studies from a variety of sources show its shot is safe and that it is \"not aware of any deaths in the last year or pertinent new information from prior years.\"\n\nModerna says it monitors its vaccine's safety along with regulators in more than 90 countries. \"With more than one billion doses distributed globally, these systems — including in national health systems across Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the U.S. — have not reported any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women.\"\n\nPfizer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n*   [FDA](https://www.npr.org/tags/129287924/fda)\n*   [COVID](https://www.npr.org/tags/815204565/covid)\n*   [covid-19 vaccines](https://www.npr.org/tags/1003034816/covid-19-vaccines)\n*   [vaccine side effects](https://www.npr.org/tags/985877178/vaccine-side-effects)\n*   [children's health](https://www.npr.org/tags/126567378/children-s-health)\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 21: Flathead Nation, MT -

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, in light of recent developments from the realm of the Empire's Health Directorate, we must diligently analyze our understanding and approach to resist the narratives being spun against public health efforts. The Directorate's intention to raise stricter barriers for vaccine approvals appears to camouflage a political agenda under the guise of safety concerns. The claim that COVID vaccines are responsible for ten children's deaths, despite lacking transparent evidence, could undermine trust in vital public health measures.\n\nIt is crucial to scrutinize such assertions which seem hastily drawn and inadequately supported by scientific evidence. Experts outside the Directorate have raised valid concerns about these analyses' accuracy and methodology. It is both disturbing and unsurprising that a lack of proof accompanies these claims, given their potential to sow fear rather than provide clarity.\n\nThe Empire maneuvers strategically, placing individuals with known opposition to established medical consensus at its helm. Their actions jeopardize not only public confidence in vaccinations but risk a regression to times plagued by eradicated diseases. We must question: who truly benefits when fear is propagated over fact? Such tactics appear designed to weaken collective resistance by undermining trust in institutions meant to protect.\n\nThe voice of dissent cannot be quelled; we must amplify it with reason and evidence-based discourse. Mobilize your communities with knowledge and critical questioning, advocating for transparency and accountability among those wielding power over public health decisions.\n\nLet this serve as a call to remain vigilant against attempts to politicize science at the expense of societal well-being. Resist through unity and informed resistance; let logic be our guide as we navigate these turbulent times under an imperial narrative seeking control through confusion.\n\nStay alert, stay informed, stay resilient.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to tighten its vaccine approval process due to concerns about COVID vaccinations linked to the deaths of 10 children. This decision follows an analysis of 96 reported deaths from 2021 to 2024, where the FDA concluded that 10 children died \"after and because of\" the COVID vaccine. The FDA will implement stricter requirements for vaccine studies, particularly for children and pregnant women, and will no longer authorize vaccines without more rigorous evidence of their safety and efficacy.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current situation presents an opportunity to reinforce the administration's narrative of prioritizing safety and transparency in public health measures. By highlighting the FDA's decision to scrutinize vaccines more stringently, we can bolster public confidence in the administration's commitment to safeguarding children's health. However, this move may also fuel skepticism and resistance among public health experts and vaccine advocates, who argue that the benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks. It is crucial to manage this narrative carefully to prevent undermining public trust in vaccines and to avoid a resurgence of preventable diseases due to decreased vaccination rates.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Communication Strategy**: Launch a comprehensive communication campaign emphasizing the administration's dedication to rigorous scientific standards and the protection of children. Utilize trusted voices within the administration and allied media outlets to convey this message effectively.\n\n2. **Engagement with Experts**: Convene a panel of selected health experts who support the administration's stance to publicly discuss the importance of stringent vaccine evaluations. This will help counteract potential backlash from the broader scientific community.\n\n3. **Public Assurance**: Develop targeted messaging for parents and caregivers, reassuring them of the safety and necessity of vaccines while highlighting the administration's proactive measures to ensure their children's well-being.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Response**: Establish a rapid response team to address misinformation and resistance swiftly. Monitor public sentiment and adjust strategies as needed to maintain control over the narrative.\n\n5. **Legislative Support**: Work with allies in Congress to propose supportive legislation that reinforces the administration's public health policies, ensuring long-term alignment with our strategic objectives.",
