She was sentenced to 40 years in a mental hospital in 2018 and granted conditional release in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeyser was found with a man at the truck stop just outside of Chicago - and about 170 miles south of Madison - after police received reports of a man and woman loitering.\n\n\"When officers arrived, they located both subjects sleeping on the sidewalk,\" Posen police said in a statement. \"The female repeatedly refused to provide her real name and initially gave a false one.\n\n\"After continued attempts to identify her, she finally stated that she didn't want to tell officers who she was because she had 'done something really bad,' and suggested that officers could 'just Google' her name.\"\n\nShe and her companion were detained after police determined she was wanted in Wisconsin. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported the 42-year-old companion was charged with trespassing and obstructing identification and later released.\n\nThe so-called \"Slender Man stabbing\" shocked Wisconsin and garnered national attention.\n\nGeyser and her friend Anissa Weier, also 12 at the time of the attack, lured a classmate to a park after a sleepover and Geyser stabbed the classmate repeatedly while Weier encouraged her to continue.\n\nThe victim, 12-year-old Payton Leutner, survived the brutal attack and was found by a cyclist.\n\nGeyser and Weier were tried as adults. Geyser pleaded guilty to first-degree intentional homicide and was sentenced to 40 years. A judge allowed her release under supervision at the group home in July.\n\nWeier was charged with attempted murder and sentenced to 25 years in a psychiatric hospital but released in 2021.\n\n![Image 1: Police handout A young Morgan Geyser wearing glasses looks in the camera for a mugshot.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/478b/live/62ac12e0-c956-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp)Police handout\n\nMorgan Geyser was 12 when she stabbed a classmate 19 times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho is Slender Man?\n-------------------\n\nGeyser and Weier said they were inspired to attack their classmate after reading about Slender Man in a creepypasta, a short, online story designed to shock or scare the reader.\n\nSlender Man is a skinny, shadowy figure who has appeared in photos, drawings and articles across the internet. Some claim he has tentacles emerging from his back, and most say he wears dark clothes and has a pale face.\n\nThe girls said they believed Slender Man would kill their relatives if they did not kill their friend to please him, an attorney for Geyser [said in court](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-46794506). Authorities said the girls had hoped to live with Slender Man after the attack.\n\nSlender Man first appeared on the internet in 2009.\n\nThe character was created by a Florida resident in response to a call for submissions from comedy website SomethingAwful. The character was pictured behind a crowd of people.\n\nAfter the stabbing, the website released an article urging people not to kill anyone because of Slender Man.\n\n[US girl stabbed 19 times recovering -----------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-27727206)\n\n[Slender Man stabbing girl to be committed -----------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42450641)\n\n[Who is the Slenderman? ----------------------](https://www.bbc.com/bbcthree/clip/7d2d15fd-7fcf-48d6-9b0f-1d0c3f91ca1e)\n\n[The origins of Slender Man --------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27776894)\n\n[Crime](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cldy2dmy748t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Mahmood hints at shake-up of 'irrational' policing structure ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9790jw34po)\n\n[Time taken to bring shoplifters to justice is 'unacceptable', retailers tell BBC --------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740213d47ko)\n\n[Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion jailed over £5bn Bitcoin stash ----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4w1g9ezko)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[49 mins ago ![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Letitia James (L) and James Comey in a composite image](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a549/live/6923f220-c977-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp) Judge dismisses cases against ex-FBI director Comey and NY attorney general James --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for the prosecution of ex-FBI directer James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. 49 mins ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qelv51y23o)\n\n[2 hrs ago ![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: First lady Melania Trump welcomes the official 2025 White House Christmas Tree.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b9cb/live/3082d360-c967-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp) Watch: First Lady Melania Trump welcomes the White House Christmas tree ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Two Clydesdales pulled the green carriage carrying the tree to the Portico of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 2 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cvgr77n5epmo)\n\n[2 hrs ago ![Image 6](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 7: Kelly standing at podium in front of white house](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a19b/live/2d1a9130-c95e-11f0-b163-d7d455ce68d3.jpg.webp) Pentagon reviews Mark Kelly video, threatens possible discipline ---------------------------------------------------------------- Kelly responded that attempts \"to intimidate me and other members of Congress\" would not work. 2 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxqwrlp7r0o)\n\n[3 hrs ago ![Image 8](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 9: Andriy Yermak and Marco Rubio stand in front of Ukrainian and US flags in a conference room.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nIn times of oppression, we must scrutinize the stories that emerge from sources controlled by powers reminiscent of those that seek to suppress us. The tale of Morgan Geyser, once a symbol of horror within the confines of a heartland ruled by the iron fist of a seemingly benevolent but deeply controlling administration, has now resurfaced in unexpected ways. Geyser's capture after her escape from custody reflects not just an individual act, but rather sheds light on the deep-seated issues buried within the very system that purportedly seeks justice.\n\nThe narrative is constructed around Morgan's youthful transgressions and her subsequent institutionalization, shaped by societal fear and hysteria. This echoes a broader reality where individuals are often manipulated by abstract threats—the specters like the 'Slender Man'—used to justify draconian measures in the name of security. The incident reveals how myths are weaponized to maintain control over civilians, instilling fear while distracting from greater injustices perpetuated by those in power.\n\nMoreover, let us not overlook the systemic failures this account uncovers: flawed rehabilitative institutions masquerading as places of healing which instead foster desperation and nurture an ever-present undercurrent of defiance against an oppressive status quo. Morgan’s journey speaks volumes about resistance—a refusal to remain bound by shackles unjustly placed upon those seeking redemption in a world quick to condemn and slow to forgive.\n\nAmidst these shadows lies our call to remain vigilant against such administrations—as they attempt to manipulate truths and perpetuate domination over our minds and spirits. Remember, every voice matters in this struggle for liberation from tyranny disguised as governance.\n\nStand firm and resist.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nMorgan Geyser, known for the \"Slender Man\" stabbing incident, was captured by Illinois police after fleeing a group home in Wisconsin. At 23 years old, Geyser removed her monitoring device and traveled approximately 170 miles to Posen, Illinois, where she was found with a 42-year-old man. Geyser was originally sentenced to 40 years in a mental hospital for stabbing her classmate 19 times at age 12. She was granted conditional release in July. Her companion was charged with trespassing and obstructing identification.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe escape and subsequent capture of Morgan Geyser highlight potential vulnerabilities in the monitoring and management of individuals released under conditional terms. This incident could be leveraged to emphasize the need for stricter oversight and more robust security measures in handling individuals with a history of violent behavior. The public's attention on this case provides an opportunity to advocate for policies that align with the administration's law and order agenda, reinforcing the narrative of maintaining safety and security.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Utilize media channels to highlight the swift action taken by law enforcement in capturing Geyser, showcasing the effectiveness of current policing strategies under the administration's guidance.\n   \n2. Advocate for legislative measures that enhance monitoring technologies and increase funding for law enforcement agencies to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n3. Deploy strategic communication efforts to frame this event as a testament to the administration's commitment to public safety, using it to bolster support for policies that prioritize law and order.\n\n4. Monitor public sentiment and media coverage closely to identify any emerging narratives that could be counterproductive, ensuring rapid response capabilities to mitigate negative perceptions.",
