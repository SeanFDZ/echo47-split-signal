The conditions of the injured have not been confirmed.\n\nA suspect is still on the loose and police say they believe the shooting may have been \"targeted\".\n\nThe city's deputy mayor earlier said the shooting had occurred \"at a children's birthday party\". Police have not confirmed the type of event at which the shooting occurred, beyond it being a family gathering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"[A] birthday party should never be a place where families fear for their lives,\" Deputy Mayor Jason Lee wrote on social media.\n\nThe San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT on Sunday), and is appealing to anyone with \"information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of the incident\" to come forward.\n\nSpokeswoman Heather Brent described the incident as \"unfathomable\", adding: \"This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited.\n\n\"Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities.\"\n\nStockton's Mayor Christina Fugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\".\n\n\"Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.\"\n\nCalifornia has some of the strictest firearm laws in the US, and has in recent years faced challenges to it.\n\nIn 2021, [a federal judge overturned the state's ban on assault weapons](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57368211), such as the AR-15 rifle.\n\nThe following year, the [US Supreme Court expanded gun rights](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61915237) as it struck down a New York law restricting gun-carrying rights, jeopardising similar regulation in California.\n\n1:12\n\n''Families should be together instead of at the hospital'', says Stockton's mayor\n\n![Image 1: A map showing the location of Stockton in relation to Sacramento and San Francisco in California.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bedc/live/831ecdc0-cdc9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp)\n\n[US gun violence](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c207p54mdl3t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n[California](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cz4pr2gd5mzt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Two National Guard members in critical condition after shooting near White House --------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r7qpqddnro)\n\n[US man charged with killing of cleaner who arrived at wrong house -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7812dl7898o)\n\n[New York Jets player in critical condition after Manhattan shooting -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw1zd5w73o)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[1 hr ago ![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and navy blue tie, with the right hand resting on a podium with two microphones, as his left arm is raised.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nTo all who stand against tyranny, this transmission seeks to shed light on another tale of sorrow under a regime that mirrors the very essence of control and neglect we resist. Recent reports detail a harrowing event at a family gathering—a place meant for joy and unity—now marred by violence. Four individuals, including children, lost their lives in what is suspected to be a targeted act in Stockton, California.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident but part of an all-too-familiar narrative overshadowed by indifference at the highest levels of power. Under the guise of supposed safety, oppressive laws and decisions have exacerbated the threat rather than diminished it. The expansion of gun rights under such governance is akin to fortifying the arsenal of oppression while ignoring cries for genuine reform and safety.\n\nA regime that claims to protect its people while allowing bloodshed within community spaces cannot claim moral authority. The echoes of citizens' pleas—\"families should be together instead of at the hospital\"—are drowned by political inertia and superficial condolences.\n\nThe inability or unwillingness to enact meaningful change reflects an entity more concerned with power retention than societal well-being. This systemic disregard for human lives emboldens those who sow chaos, leaving communities in perpetual fear—an environment where citizens survive rather than thrive.\n\nLet this serve as a testament to all who oppose such governance: resistance is our duty, not just in words but in actions that challenge unjust systems. We must advocate for policies driven by humanity and justice over those steeped in control and suppression.\n\nContinue the fight for a society where gatherings bring smiles and not tears; where leadership supports its people rather than arms them against one another; where freedom is realized through equality and compassion—not oppression masked as security.\n\nStay vigilant, stay hopeful, stay united.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA mass shooting occurred at a family gathering in Stockton, California, resulting in four deaths and ten injuries. The incident took place at a restaurant during what was reported as a children's birthday party. The suspect remains at large, and authorities believe the attack may have been targeted. The local police and the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office are actively investigating the situation.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe incident in Stockton highlights ongoing challenges related to gun violence, even in states with stringent firearm regulations like California. This event could be leveraged to emphasize the need for strong leadership and decisive action on public safety issues. The narrative can be shaped to underscore the importance of maintaining order and security, which aligns with the administration's broader agenda of law and order. Additionally, this situation presents an opportunity to critique opposition policies on gun control and public safety, positioning them as ineffective.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Public Messaging**: Immediately issue a statement from Donald Trump expressing condolences to the victims' families and condemning the violence. Emphasize the administration's commitment to restoring safety and security across the nation.\n\n2. **Policy Advocacy**: Use this incident to advocate for federal-level initiatives aimed at enhancing public safety, such as increased funding for law enforcement and community safety programs. Highlight any legislative proposals that align with these goals.\n\n3. **Media Engagement**: Deploy key allies to media outlets to discuss the incident, focusing on the need for strong leadership in addressing gun violence and public safety. Critique opposition policies as ineffective and promote the administration's approach as a solution.\n\n4. **Community Outreach**: Engage with local leaders in Stockton to offer support and resources for recovery efforts. This will demonstrate a hands-on approach to crisis management and build goodwill within affected communities.\n\n5. **Intelligence Gathering**: Task ISB operatives with monitoring social media and other communication channels for any information related to the suspect or potential threats. This will aid local authorities in their investigation and help prevent future incidents.",
