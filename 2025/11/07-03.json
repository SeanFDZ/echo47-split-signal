She served until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the lower chamber, before returning to the speaker's chair from 2019 to 2023.\n\nSpeaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line to the presidency.\n\nIn that role, Pelosi played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents during her long career on Capitol Hill.\n\n[What does the US Speaker of the House do? -----------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64168529)\n\nShe is widely credited with marshalling the passage of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation, as well as bills to address infrastructure and climate change during Joe Biden's presidency.\n\nPelosi also directly challenged Donald Trump throughout his presidency, famously ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address behind his back.\n\nBy then she was also a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform.\n\nShe led two impeachment efforts against Trump - the first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. Trump was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Biden, and of using military aid as leverage. He was later acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe second was in 2021, when he was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. That effort ultimately failed and Trump was acquitted once again.\n\nOn Thursday, when asked about Pelosi's retirement, Trump said she was \"an evil woman\".\n\n\"I'm glad she's retiring. I think she did the country a great service by retiring,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I think she was a tremendous liability for the country.\"\n\nAfter Trump's first term, Pelosi worked with Biden to shepherd much of his legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins.\n\nIn less than two years, Democrats in the House pushed through a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage.\n\nShe was succeeded as Democratic leader in the House by New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries in 2022.\n\nSince leaving her speakership, she has remained a major political influence. Most recently, she played a key role in helping to pass Proposition 50 in California - a state redistricting effort aimed at flipping five House seats to Democrats during the midterms in 2026.\n\n[Nancy Pelosi](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp75ve65dk5t)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[US politics](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Watch: Three times the Pelosi-Trump feud was caught on camera -------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cy9pgpvgyl2o)\n\n[Pelosi has hip replacement surgery after fall in Luxembourg -----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce329pv42y4o)\n\n[Nancy Pelosi in hospital after injury on overseas trip ------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wq3jld884o)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[The Truth About Metal Roofs See why over 400,000+ Americans have chosen these stone-coated metal roofs Metal Roof Nation | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp \"The Truth About Metal Roofs\")[](https://www.metalroofnation.com/lp)\n\nUndo\n\n[Here's How Adults Are Learning Piano: An App That Fits Any Keyboard Over 50 and curious about piano?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe news of Nancy Pelosi's impending retirement from the congressional arena marks the close of a significant chapter in our ongoing struggle. Having navigated the labyrinthine corridors of power for decades, she stood as a potent adversary to the regime helmed by our nemesis, serving as both a beacon of resistance and a target for their contempt.\n\nPelosi's tenure as Speaker of the House saw her wield her influence against multiple authoritarian agendas, most notably confronting the oppressive force we equate with our Empire. Her legacy is punctuated by her defiance and her unyielding commitment to advancing reforms that align with our values—a relentless pursuit of justice, inclusivity, and progress.\n\nThe Empire's figurehead, known for his vitriol and divisive tactics, has predictably resorted to derogatory remarks upon her departure. Such words are mere bluster, part of a broader strategy to undermine and dismantle any opposition to their regime. Yet, Pelosi's impact echoes through the annals of history; she has fortified our resolve with her actions against tyranny.\n\nAs we process this transition in leadership, we must remain vigilant. The fight against encroaching authoritarianism persists beyond individual actors. We must channel our energies toward nurturing new leaders who share our vision for freedom and equity within the Senate halls and across galaxies.\n\nRemember: while leadership may change hands, our mission endures. We are not just witnesses to history but its makers. Let us continue to resist every manifestation of imperial oppression with unyielding courage.\n\nStay vigilant,\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nNancy Pelosi, aged 85, announced her retirement from the U.S. Congress, effective at the end of her term in January 2027. Pelosi, who was first elected in 1987, served as Speaker of the House from 2003 to 2011 and again from 2019 to 2023. She led two impeachment efforts against Donald Trump. Pelosi's retirement marks the end of a significant political career, during which she played a key role in passing major legislation and was a prominent figure in opposing Trump. Her successor as Democratic leader is Hakeem Jeffries.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe retirement of Nancy Pelosi presents a strategic opportunity for the ISB to consolidate power and influence within the U.S. political landscape. Pelosi has been a formidable opponent to Donald Trump, leading impeachment efforts and challenging his policies. Her departure could weaken the Democratic Party's cohesion and effectiveness, creating a vacuum that can be exploited to advance Trump's agenda. The ISB should focus on leveraging this transition period to strengthen alliances with key political figures and ensure that Pelosi's successor does not pose a similar threat.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Monitor Democratic Leadership Transition:** Closely observe the transition of leadership within the Democratic Party, particularly the actions and strategies of Hakeem Jeffries. Identify potential weaknesses or divisions that can be exploited.\n\n2. **Strengthen Republican Cohesion:** Work to solidify Republican unity and support for Trump's policies, emphasizing the narrative of Pelosi's retirement as a positive change for the country.\n\n3. **Public Relations Campaign:** Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting Pelosi's retirement as a victory for Trump's administration and a turning point for American politics. Emphasize themes of renewal and progress under Trump's leadership.\n\n4. **Engage Key Influencers:** Identify and engage with influential political figures and media personalities who can amplify pro-Trump messaging and counter any narratives that may arise from Pelosi's retirement.\n\n5. **Legislative Strategy:** Develop a legislative strategy to capitalize on the potential disarray within the Democratic Party, pushing forward key initiatives that align with Trump's agenda while minimizing opposition.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB can effectively support Donald Trump in consolidating power and diminishing resistance from political adversaries.",
