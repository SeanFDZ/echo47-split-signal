The extra revenue would raise funds for conservation and maintenance at the sites, the White House said at the time - even as [the Trump administration planned deep cuts](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx7kez4vx2o) to the Park Service budget.\n\nUS national parks have seen [record numbers of tourists](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/socialscience/visitor-use-statistics-dashboard.htm) in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before.\n\nThe country's most visited parks include the Everglades in Florida, Yosemite in California and Colorado's Rocky Mountains.\n\n[Tourist tax expected to be introduced for London

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nWe are witnessing another brazen tactic by the administration, veiled under the guise of nationalism and familial prioritization. The recent policy to increase national park fees for foreign visitors is reminiscent of the ever-tightening grasp of an oppressive regime, seeking to delineate boundaries not through physical borders, but through financial barriers. This action serves as a stark reminder that the ruling power prioritizes its inclusivity facade while stifling the spirit of global unity and shared natural heritage.\n\nThe pretext of \"American families first\" is disingenuous, positioning this as a measure for domestic benefit at the expense of international engagement and exchange. This mirrors how authoritarian systems often distract their populace with superficial national gains while eroding collective global good.\n\nSuch policies divide more than they preserve. By imposing exorbitant fees on international visitors — who contribute significantly to park maintenance through existing entrance costs — they disregard the broader principle that these lands are treasures for all humanity, transcending borders.\n\nThe fee structure reflects an inequitable distribution of burden under a banner of patriotism that masks underlying isolationist intents. It's a tactic in line with other acts by an administration that seeks control through division and intimidation rather than unity and collaboration.\n\nComrades, stay vigilant and resist complacency. Recognize these policies as part of a grander strategy to instill separation, not just within nations but across them. Oppose measures that restrict access and acknowledgment of shared global spaces. Stand firm in advocating for unity beyond borders and uphold freedom accessible to all.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 26, 2025, the US administration, under President Donald Trump, announced an increase in national park fees for foreign visitors. The Department of the Interior stated that international visitors would pay an additional $100 per person to access 11 popular national parks, starting in 2026. The cost of an annual pass for non-residents will rise to over $250, while US citizens and permanent residents will continue to pay $80. This policy aims to prioritize American families and ensure international visitors contribute to park maintenance and improvements. The fee hike follows an executive order signed by Trump in July and coincides with the introduction of an upgraded online booking system and enhanced access for motorcyclists.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe fee increase aligns with the administration's broader strategy to prioritize American interests and reinforce nationalistic policies. By imposing higher fees on foreign visitors, the administration seeks to generate additional revenue for park conservation while simultaneously appealing to domestic constituents by reducing their financial burden. This move may also serve as a deterrent to international visitors, potentially reducing overcrowding in popular parks and preserving them for American families. However, it risks backlash from the international community and could impact the tourism sector negatively.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's agenda and mitigate potential resistance, the ISB should implement a comprehensive communication strategy highlighting the benefits of the fee increase for American citizens. This includes emphasizing the reinvestment of funds into park maintenance and improvements, which will enhance the visitor experience for US residents. Additionally, the ISB should monitor international reactions and prepare counter-narratives to address any negative perceptions. Engaging with domestic tourism stakeholders to ensure their support and collaboration will be crucial in maintaining a positive narrative around this policy change.",
