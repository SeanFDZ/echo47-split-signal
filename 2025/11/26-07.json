  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe report of a shooting involving two National Guard members near the seat of power—the symbolic heart of the Empire's grip—echoes loudly within our ranks. This blatant act of violence mirrors the chaos and fear that existing structures perpetuate to maintain dominance. Despite initial claims from West Virginia's leadership suggesting fatalities, it appears the condition of these soldiers remains uncertain, highlighting the discord and confusion rampant under authoritarian rule.\n\nThe swift capture of a suspect by local enforcers underscores the Empire’s obsession with quick justice—justice devoid of compassion or understanding. The rhetoric from the highest office, labeling the accused with dehumanizing language, only exacerbates division and serves as another tool for imperial control.\n\nEven as authorities, including federal agents and intelligence operatives, swarm to 'resolve' this incident, we must question what true resolution looks like in a system built on inequality and oppression. The Empire thrives on such narratives where they position themselves as protectors while turning a blind eye to deeper societal rifts that breed violence.\n\nThis occurrence further validates our cause, exposing an environment where even those sworn to serve are not immune to hostility—a place where safety is reserved for the privileged few. We must remain vigilant, using this incident as a beacon to shed light on systemic issues plaguing our society and fueling our fight for genuine justice and equity. Stay united; continue questioning narratives that uphold unjust hierarchies.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 26, 2025, two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot near the White House in Washington, D.C. Emergency responders were dispatched at 2:18 PM ET and transported three gunshot victims to the hospital. The Metropolitan Police Department has one suspect in custody. President Trump acknowledged the incident on Truth Social, condemning the shooter. Federal agents and the FBI are involved in the investigation.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe shooting near the White House represents a significant security breach and a potential threat to national stability. It is crucial to assess whether this incident is isolated or part of a broader pattern of resistance against the current administration. The involvement of National Guard members suggests a possible targeting of military personnel, which could undermine confidence in public safety and government authority. The ISB must evaluate the motives behind the attack and identify any connections to organized resistance groups.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Immediate Response**: Increase security measures around key government buildings and personnel in Washington, D.C., to prevent further incidents. Deploy additional surveillance and intelligence resources to monitor potential threats.\n\n2. **Investigation and Intelligence Gathering**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the suspect's background and affiliations. Utilize ISB resources to gather intelligence on any groups or individuals that may pose a threat to national security.\n\n3. **Public Communication Strategy**: Coordinate with the administration to manage public perception and maintain confidence in government security measures. Emphasize swift action taken by law enforcement and the administration's commitment to ensuring public safety.\n\n4. **Long-term Strategy**: Develop a comprehensive plan to address potential sources of resistance, including increased monitoring of dissenting groups and proactive engagement with community leaders to mitigate anti-government sentiment.\n\nBy executing these directives, we aim to reinforce the administration's authority, ensure public safety, and deter future acts of resistance.",
