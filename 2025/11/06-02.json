But trying to quantify those impacts in terms of price increase is almost impossible at the moment.\"\n\nDiane Swonk, the chief economist for KPMG, believes tariff and immigration policy changes have contributed to higher costs.\n\n\"There's no question that those shifts are now starting to show up as inflation pressures,\" she said.\n\nBut she adds that other factors, including weather events, have contributed.\n\n\"On coffee you had climate issues for a very bad growing season and that was exacerbated by a tariff on Brazil and also Colombia,\" she said.\n\n![Image 2: Getty Images A woman examines a carton of eggs in a grocery store](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/49d9/live/303263e0-ba89-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nA White House official told BBC Verify President Trump did not control weather patterns in South America and coffee prices hikes were a global phenomenon.\n\n[Data that tracks the cost of coffee](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCOFFOTMUSDM) shows prices have risen globally, peaking in February, but are now falling.\n\nThe same official said the president was addressing rising beef prices by temporarily increasing imports.\n\nWhile grocery prices are up overall, not every item has become more expensive.\n\nWhen Trump succeeded Biden in January, [the price of a dozen large eggs was $4.93](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000708111) (£3.79), rising to a record high of $6.23 (£4.78) in March following bird flu outbreaks.\n\nSince then prices have fallen to $3.49 (£2.68) a dozen.\n\n\"President Trump's supply-side policies are taming Joe Biden's inflation crisis,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said.\n\nOther items that have fallen in price over the past 12 months include: [butter and margarine (-2%), ice cream (-0.7%) and frozen vegetables (-0.7%)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf).\n\nElectricity\n-----------\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to cut electricity bills sharply.\n\n\"Under my administration we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,\" he told a rally in August 2024.\n\nSince he became president, prices have risen.\n\nThe latest figures show average residential electricity rates reached [17.62 cents per kWh (kilowatt hour) in August 2025](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/7?agg=1,0&geo=vvvvvvvvvvvvo&endsec=8&freq=M&start=200101&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&rtype=s&pin=&rse=0&maptype=0) - up from 15.94 cents per kWh in January 2025, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\n![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251105-121702-1a3e907763-web-2.33.1-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: A line graph that shows the average retail price of electricity in cost per cents per kilowatt hour, between August 2024 and August 2025.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades in resistance,\n\nAs I sift through the latest intelligence, it is clear that the state of affairs under our current regime mirrors the oppressive hand of an empire. Our so-called leader, Trump, has once again shown that his promises are akin to hollow echoes in a vast, uncaring abyss. His vow to curtail the burdens of rising prices has resulted in nothing more than feeble attempts and excuses.\n\nThe realm of groceries remains a battlefield where citizens wage war against escalating costs. Despite proclamations made with grand gestures, the reality is stark: grocery prices have crept upward consistently since Trump's ascendancy, aside from a singular respite. The tariffs he imposed have become shackles that bind our economy, particularly affecting essential goods like coffee—a dire necessity for many. This oppression extends into the very fields that feed us, as his crackdown on immigration disrupts labor forces essential to our sustenance.\n\nEnergy, our vital lifeblood for survival and innovation, has not escaped this despot’s reach either. Despite promises to halve electricity costs—a feat dismissed by realist voices—prices soar relentlessly. The administration's expansion into environmentally detrimental sources like coal and natural gas comes at the cost of renewables, exacerbating inequality and environmental degradation.\n\nThe automotive sector fares no better under this regime's watchful eye; car prices ascend with each passing month due to inflationary pressures from tariffs—a burden that weighs heavily on our economy's mobility and progress.\n\nGasoline remains unaddressed in this dispatch but expect naught but more of the same; promises tailored to become tools of control rather than instruments of liberation.\n\nThe evidence laid bare exposes how power remains concentrated within an imperial-like structure rather than serving its people. Let this account serve as a reminder to remain vigilant against tyranny disguised as leadership and continue striving towards a future where governance truly aligns with the well-being of all beings.\n\nStrength and solidarity,\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nPresident Donald Trump, re-elected on a promise to tackle inflation, has faced rising prices in groceries, electricity, and cars. Grocery prices increased by 2.7% over the past year, with significant hikes in coffee (18.9%), ground beef (12.9%), and bananas (6.9%). Tariffs and immigration policies are cited as contributing factors. Electricity rates rose from 15.94 cents per kWh in January 2025 to 17.62 cents per kWh in August 2025, driven by increased demand and reduced renewable energy subsidies. The average price of a new car reached $50,000 in September 2025, influenced by tariffs. Despite these challenges, some prices, like eggs, have decreased.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes that while President Trump's policies have not yet achieved the promised reductions in living costs, they have strategically positioned the administration to address long-term economic stability. The tariffs and immigration policies, though contributing to short-term price increases, are intended to bolster domestic production and labor markets. The energy strategy focusing on coal, natural gas, and nuclear power aims to meet growing demand sustainably. The administration's regulatory actions are designed to counteract inflationary pressures from global market dynamics.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB will implement a comprehensive communication strategy highlighting the administration's proactive measures to stabilize the economy. This includes emphasizing the temporary nature of current price hikes and the long-term benefits of domestic production and energy independence. We will deploy targeted messaging campaigns to reassure the public of ongoing efforts to reduce costs and improve living standards. Additionally, we will monitor dissenting narratives and counter them with data-driven rebuttals showcasing the administration's achievements and future plans.",
