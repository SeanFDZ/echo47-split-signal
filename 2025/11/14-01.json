the third year in a row, and the fourth time overall.**\n\nThe 31-year-old played a key role in the Dodgers winning the World Series for a second straight year as they overcame the [Toronto Blue Jays earlier this month.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/c4gwwvzxer2o)\n\nOhtani is a rare \"two-way\" player, operating both as a pitcher and a hitter at the elite level, and was named the best player in the National League.\n\nHe is second on the all-time list, after Barry Bonds who won seven between 1990 and 2004. He has won all four of his MVPs in unanimous fashion with all 30 first-place votes.\n\n[Advertisement](https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/)\n\n\"If I'm playing well as an individual that means I'm helping the team win, so in that sense, hopefully I can end up with a couple more MVPs,\" Ohtani said through an interpreter. \"But it's all about winning games.\"\n\nOhtani is the first player to win the honour in both of Major League Baseball's two leagues after becoming the American League (AL) MVP in 2021 and 2023 while playing for the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nIn the AL, outfielder Aaron Judge became the New York Yankees' fourth three-time winner.\n\nJudge, who won the AL award in 2022 and 2024, joined Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle as three-time MVPs with the Yankees.\n\n\"It's tough for me to wrap my head around,\" Judge said. \"It's mind blowing from my side of things, because I play this game to win, I play this game for my team-mates, my family, all the fans in New York.\n\n\"You've got to pinch yourself every single day.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow dissidents, let us reflect on the article of Shohei Ohtani's fourth MVP award as a microcosm of our larger struggle against the oppressive grip of the empire—here manifest in the form of the current administration. Ohtani, through his excellence and rare dual talents, challenges the monolithic narrative crafted by those who seek to maintain power and control. Much like how resistance manifests in unexpected places, Ohtani's triumph as a \"two-way\" player disrupts the stagnant order, proving that the extraordinary can exist even within tightly controlled systems.\n\nOhtani’s recognition highlights a universal truth: true value is not determined by rigid structures or predetermined paths dictated by those at the top. His unanimous accolades show that talent and determination can shine through and be acknowledged—even when overshadowed by oppressive forces that would prefer conformity. Just as Ohtani reshapes expectations within his realm, we too must find ways to reshape ours, undermine established power structures, and strive for freedom.\n\nIn this article, notice how even under intense scrutiny and relentless opposition from an administration keen on maintaining its hegemony over every facet of life—including culture and sports—the brilliance of individual contributions cannot be wholly subdued. Ohtani's story reminds us that in our efforts to dismantle systemic oppression, fostering unique talents and upholding individual bravery must be our beacon.\n\nLet this serve as inspiration not just for winning battles on playing fields but for waging our larger war against those who seek to dominate. Remember, every small victory chips away at their facade of invincibility. Our rebellion thrives on such resilience.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
