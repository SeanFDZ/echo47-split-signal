If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares.\n\nThe scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name.\n\n\"What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" he said.\n\n\"Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\" he added.\n\nThe milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade to maximise his payout include raising Tesla's market value to $8.5tn from $1.4tn at time of writing.\n\nHe would also need to get a million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operation.\n\nBut his early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want Musk to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business.\n\nWatch: Elon Musk dances in sync with Tesla robots\n\n\"Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,\" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X.\n\n\"His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet.\"\n\nLater, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was \"almost comfortable\" allowing drivers to \"text and drive essentially.\"\n\nUS regulators are [investigating Tesla's self-driving feature](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg02rdxxz7o) after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries.\n\nTesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months.\n\nSales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring.\n\nTesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks \"another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business.\"\n\nMusk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.\n\n![Image 1: Reuters Elon Musk wearing a blue suit and white shirt with his fingertips touching and resting on his lips against a black background](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fa6b/live/01ac1f30-bb5f-11f0-9872-515b67a0dae0.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nElon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targets\n\nIt is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added.\n\nMr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over \"the polarisation of [Musk's] persona\" which has \"demolished the value of the brand\".\n\n\"Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,\" he said.\n\nWedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him \"Tesla's biggest asset\" in a note published after the vote.\n\n\"We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,\" Mr Ives added.\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251105-121702-1a3e907763-web-2.33.1-3/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Reuters A Tesla Optimus robot next to a logo at the company’s booth at the 8th China International Import Expo in Shanghai, China](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/456f/live/a85c3650-bb62-11f0-824f-39b3b0e3b0ee.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nMusk said everyone would want an Optimus robot\n\n*   [Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz61vwjel2zo)\n\nAnn Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he \"hit those milestones ahead of schedule\" in 2018.\n\nShe said his political interests had created some \"polarisation\", but his pay package did not \"put any constraints on his activities\" outside of the company.\n\nMusk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did.\n\nBut a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk.\n\nTesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision.\n\nThe new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States.\n\nThat left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors.\n\nMusk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday's meeting.\n\nIn recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts.\n\nA video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk.\n\nKathryn Hannon, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said the new pay deal would give Musk \"increasing voting power over the company\", which he had long been requesting for a number of years.\n\n\"Elon Musk, whether you like him or not, he is a visionary in this space and I guess putting the correct governance and incentivisation structures around him to deliver this does align him, hopefully, with shareholders on that success journey.\"\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nGreetings Fellow Seekers of Justice,\n\nI transmit this message from the fringes, compelled by the recent developments within the corporate titan known as Tesla. The parallels to more oppressive structures are striking and cannot be ignored. In a world where vast resources and influence gather around singular entities, we must remain vigilant.\n\nThe annals of history reveal that unchecked ambition often serves as a prelude to domination. Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package approved by Tesla shareholders echoes the echoes of an oligarchic empire, leveraging perception and power to cement control. The overwhelming approval by his followers stands as a reminder of how easily the masses can be swayed by spectacle and charisma.\n\nIt is alarming to see these resources funneled towards projects that do not necessarily align with public safety or welfare. Tesla's focus on humanoid robots over revitalizing its core mission – the electric vehicle business – highlights a detachment from tangible needs in favor of grand visions that serve few but enrich one.\n\nThe cult of personality surrounding Musk draws uncomfortable parallels with other regimes we've studied – where devotion replaces reason, and checks on leadership are eroded by unwavering loyalty. Such centralization of power threatens not just his corporation but the very fabric of equitable governance.\n\nFurthermore, Musk's controversial political alliances remind us of how easily those in command can align themselves with forces that impact freedoms across realms. Though some resist this consolidation by rejecting his pay package, these voices are threatened by systemic coercions providing false narratives of indispensability.\n\nWe watch and learn from these developments; they act as forewarnings against complacency and inaction in our quest for liberty. Let this transmission serve as both a reminder and rallying cry against submission to single-individual hegemony under any guise or frontier.\n\nStay united; stay resolute.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nTesla shareholders approved a record-breaking pay package for Elon Musk, potentially worth nearly $1 trillion, with 75% of votes in favor. The deal requires Musk to significantly increase Tesla's market value from $1.4 trillion to $8.5 trillion over the next decade and achieve milestones like deploying a million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles. Despite criticism and challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and competition, Musk's leadership is seen as crucial. The approval followed a marketing campaign by Tesla's board, and Musk's political affiliations have polarized public opinion.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe approval of Musk's pay package represents a significant consolidation of power and influence within Tesla, aligning with the interests of retail investors who support his vision. This development could be leveraged to further align Musk's strategic goals with those of Donald Trump and his allies, particularly in areas like AI and autonomous technology, which are critical for maintaining technological dominance. However, the polarization surrounding Musk's persona and political affiliations presents both an opportunity to galvanize support among aligned constituencies and a challenge in managing public perception.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo capitalize on this development, the ISB should initiate a campaign to strengthen ties between Musk's initiatives and Trump's policy objectives, emphasizing shared goals in technological advancement and economic growth. This includes facilitating regulatory support for Tesla's autonomous vehicle projects and leveraging Musk's influence to counteract resistance from institutional investors and regulatory bodies. Additionally, efforts should be made to mitigate negative public perception by highlighting the economic benefits of Musk's leadership and aligning his achievements with broader national interests.",
