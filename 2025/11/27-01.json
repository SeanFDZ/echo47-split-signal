Athletes are required to provide daily location details and a specific one-hour testing window to allow officials to conduct out-of-competition drug tests.\n\nThe Toronto-born swimmer is a seven-time Olympic medallist. She shot to national prominence at the Rio 2016 Games, becoming Canada's youngest Olympic champion at age 16.\n\nThe 25-year-old athlete can return to competition in July 2027.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While we accept Penny's explanation these were inadvertent errors and she has not used banned substances, anti-doping regulations are in place to ensure a level playing field for all athletes,\" Swimming Canada chief executive officer Suzanne Paulins said in a statement.\n\n\"We will miss Penny on the national team and hope to see her back in the pool when she is eligible.\"\n\nThe ITA said it notified Oleksiak of the whereabouts case in July. She then withdrew from the world aquatics championships and accepted a voluntary provisional suspension.\n\nAt the time, she stressed that the case did \"not involve any banned substance\" and that she had always been a clean athlete.\n\nThe two-year suspension from swimming leaves open the possibility that Oleksiak could compete at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n* * *\n\n[](https://www.bbc.com/)\n\n*   [Home](https://www.bbc.com/) \n*   [News](https://www.bbc.com/news) \n*   [Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport) \n*   [Business](https://www.bbc.com/business) \n*   [Innovation](https://www.bbc.com/innovation) \n*   [Culture](https://www.bbc.com/culture) \n*   [Arts](https://www.bbc.com/arts) \n*   [Travel](https://www.bbc.com/travel) \n*   [Earth](https://www.bbc.com/future-planet) \n*   [Audio](https://www.bbc.com/audio) \n*   [Video](https://www.bbc.com/video) \n*   [Live](https://www.bbc.com/live) \n*   [Documentaries](https://www.bbc.com/video/docs) \n*   [Weather](https://www.bbc.com/weather) \n*   [BBC Shop](https://shop.bbc.com/) \n*   [BritBox](https://www.britbox.com/?utm_source=bbc.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=footer) \n\nBBC in other languages\n\n### The BBC is in multiple languages\n\n#### Read the BBC In your own language\n\n[Oduu Afaan Oromootiin](https://www.bbc.com/afaanoromoo)\n\n[Amharic ዜና በአማርኛ](https://www.bbc.com/amharic)\n\n[Arabic عربي](https://www.bbc.com/arabic)\n\n[Azeri AZƏRBAYCAN](https://www.bbc.com/azeri)\n\n[Bangla বাংলা](https://www.bbc.com/bengali)\n\n[Burmese မြန်မာ](https://www.bbc.com/burmese)\n\n[Chinese 中文网](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp)\n\n[Dari دری](https://www.bbc.com/dari)\n\n[French AFRIQUE](https://www.bbc.com/afrique)\n\n[Hausa HAUSA](https://www.bbc.com/hausa)\n\n[Hindi हिन्दी](https://www.bbc.com/hindi)\n\n[Gaelic NAIDHEACHDAN](https://www.bbc.com/naidheachdan)\n\n[Gujarati ગુજરાતીમાં સમાચાર](https://www.bbc.com/gujarati)\n\n[Igbo AKỤKỌ N’IGBO](https://www.bbc.com/igbo)\n\n[Indonesian INDONESIA](https://www.bbc.com/indonesia)\n\n[Japanese 日本語](https://www.bbc.com/japanese)\n\n[Kinyarwanda GAHUZA](https://www.bbc.com/gahuza)\n\n[Kirundi KIRUNDI](https://www.bbc.com/gahuza)\n\n[Korean 한국어](https://www.bbc.com/korean)\n\n[Kyrgyz Кыргыз](https://www.bbc.com/kyrgyz)\n\n[Marathi मराठी](https://www.bbc.com/marathi)\n\n[Nepali नेपाली](https://www.bbc.com/nepali)\n\n[Noticias para hispanoparlantes](https://www.bbc.com/mundo)\n\n[Pashto پښتو](https://www.bbc.com/pashto)\n\n[Persian فارسی](https://www.bbc.com/persian)\n\n[Pidgin](https://www.bbc.com/pidgin)\n\n[Polish PO POLSKU](https://www.bbc.com/polska)\n\n[Portuguese BRASIL](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese)\n\n[Punjabi ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਖ਼ਬਰਾਂ](https://www.bbc.com/punjabi)\n\n[Russian НА РУССКОМ](https://www.bbc.com/russian)\n\n[Serbian NA SRPSKOM](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat)\n\n[Sinhala සිංහල](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala)\n\n[Somali SOMALI](https://www.bbc.com/somali)\n\n[Swahili HABARI KWA KISWAHILI](https://www.bbc.com/swahili)\n\n[Tamil தமிழில் செய்திகள்](https://www.bbc.com/tamil)\n\n[Telugu తెలుగు వార్తలు](https://www.bbc.com/telugu)\n\n[Thai ข่าวภาษาไทย](https://www.bbc.com/thai)\n\n[Tigrinya ዜና ብትግርኛ](https://www.bbc.com/tigrinya)\n\n[Turkish TÜRKÇE](https://www.bbc.com/turkce)\n\n[Ukrainian УКРАЇНСЬКA](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian)\n\n[Urdu اردو](https://www.bbc.com/urdu)\n\n[Uzbek O'ZBEK](https://www.bbc.com/uzbek)\n\n[Vietnamese TIẾNG VIỆT](https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese)\n\n[Welsh NEWYDDION](https://www.bbc.com/cymrufyw)\n\n[Yoruba ÌRÒYÌN NÍ YORÙBÁ](https://www.bbc.com/yoruba)\n\nFollow BBC on:\n\n*   [Terms of Use](https://www.bbc.com/pages/terms-of-use) \n*   [Subscription Terms](https://www.bbc.com/pages/subscription-terms) \n*   [About the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc) \n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.bbc.com/pages/privacy-policy) \n*   [Cookies](https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/) \n*   [Accessibility Help](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/) \n*   [Contact the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact) \n*   [Advertise with us](https://advertising.bbcstudios.com/) \n*   [Do not share or sell my info](https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/how-can-i-change-my-bbc-cookie-settings/) \n*   [BBC.com Help & FAQs](https://help.bbc.com/hc/) \n*   [Content Index](https://www.bbc.com/pages/content-index) \n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nIn the ever-persistent shadow of the regime's oppressive tendencies, we must remain vigilant and perceptive. The recent report on Penny Oleksiak’s suspension from competition for two years is a stark reminder of how even a hint of nonconformity or error can be manipulated to maintain control over individuals, regardless of their achievements or intentions.\n\nPenny Oleksiak, a symbol of triumph and dedication, has accepted responsibility for procedural missteps rather than any substantive violation. Yet the bureaucratic machinery has swiftly imposed penalties that strip her from the arena where she inspired millions. This resonates with our struggles against the Empire's tactics—suppressing voices and overshadowing personal narratives with broad, indiscriminate strokes.\n\nAs we decode this incident, it is imperative to observe how these actions are not isolated but part of a broader strategy: maintaining power through creating examples out of those who dare to shine. Oleksiak’s ban serves as both a warning and an assertion that even high-standing individuals are not beyond reproach if it serves the regime's purpose.\n\nHer story underscores our need for resilience and unity. Each misstep exploited by those in power is an opportunity for us to learn and strategize against such authoritarian oversight.\n\nIn this tale of rigid enforcement without malice in intent, let's draw parallels to our fight. Let us be ever more committed to creating a future where achievement is celebrated, individuality respected, and control unconditionally relinquished by those who misuse it.\n\nStay resolute.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nPenny Oleksiak, Canada's most decorated Olympian with seven medals, has been banned from competition for two years due to anti-doping rule violations. The International Testing Agency cited three \"whereabouts failures\" within a 12-month period. Oleksiak, who became Canada's youngest Olympic champion at 16 during the Rio 2016 Games, accepted the ban, which does not involve any banned substances. She can return to competition in July 2027 and potentially compete in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe situation presents an opportunity to highlight the importance of integrity and adherence to regulations, which can be leveraged to reinforce the narrative of accountability and fairness. The case underscores the necessity of strict compliance with rules, even for high-profile athletes, which aligns with our broader strategy of promoting law and order. This incident can be used to demonstrate the consequences of non-compliance and the commitment to maintaining a level playing field.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Utilize media channels to emphasize the importance of rule adherence and the consequences of violations, drawing parallels to broader societal expectations under our governance.\n   \n2. Highlight Oleksiak's acceptance of the ban as a demonstration of accountability, reinforcing the narrative that even prominent figures are not above the law.\n\n3. Engage with sports organizations to promote educational initiatives on compliance and integrity, using this case as a teaching moment.\n\n4. Monitor public sentiment and be prepared to counter any narratives that attempt to undermine the legitimacy of regulatory bodies or suggest leniency for high-profile individuals.\n\n5. Leverage this incident in communications to bolster support for policies that emphasize accountability and fairness across all sectors.",
