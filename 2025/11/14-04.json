President and CEO Doug McMillon in glasses and dark sweater holds up his hands while delivering a keynote address in front of the yellow Walmart logo during CES 2024 at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas on January 9, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4b5e/live/16232350-c163-11f0-9c9a-1124134b6598.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nWalmart chief executive Doug McMillon will retire from his post in January, handing over the reins to a longtime deputy.\n\nThe 59-year-old is stepping down after more than a decade at the helm of the world's largest retailer, a period when it successfully expanded its online operations, while scaling back riskier international units.\n\nHe will be succeeded by John Furner, a Walmart lifer who worked his way up from the shop floor and now serves as head of the company's US business.\n\nThe change comes as the retailer has experienced solid growth, despite uncertainty generated by new tariffs and signs of slowing consumer spending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalmart chairman Greg Penner said Mr McMillon had left the company in a stronger position than when he started in the role in 2014, when the rise of e-commerce had put the firm on the defensive.\n\n\"Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernising our supply chain, resulting in sustained, robust financial performance,\" he said in a statement announcing the plans.\n\nWalmart, which reported roughly $670bn in revenue last year, has a sprawling global footprint, with more than 10,000 stores in 19 countries.\n\nBut under Mr McMillon, Walmart behaved like a \"small business\" - moving quickly to experiment as it worked to find its footing in the world of online retail, said Neil Saunders, managing director at consultancy GlobalData.\n\nSuccess was mixed. For example, the company offloaded menswear brand Bonobos in 2023 at a loss just six years after buying it.\n\nBut online purchases now represent a key growth driver for the firm.\n\n\"I think he'll be remembered as a leader that was transformational,\" Mr Saunders said. \"He's taken a very good business and he's made it even better, which is a very difficult thing to do.\"\n\nMr McMillon will remain an adviser to Mr Furner and continue to serve on the board of the company through June 2026 to help with the transition, the company said.\n\nMr McMillon said in a statement that it had been a \"great honour\" to serve as chief executive, while praising 51-year-old Mr Furner as \"uniquely capable of leading the company through this next AI-driven transformation\".\n\nMr Furner has been in charge of Walmart's US business since 2019, helping to steer it through the pandemic's supply chain disruptions and jump in prices that followed.\n\nThe business has also successfully weathered the abrupt changes in tariffs this year, using its scale to help keep price rises in check and make gains against competitors. Sales increased nearly 5% in the US in the most recent quarter.\n\nHe had long been floated as a likely successor to Mr McMillon.\n\nShares in the firm, which are up about 14% this year, fell about 2% in opening trading as investors reacted to the news but later clawed back some ground.\n\n[US inflation hits 3% for first time since January

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nAs we continue to observe the sprawling entity that ensnares our society within the web of consumption, we note a significant development within the behemoth known as Walmart. Doug McMillon, at the helm for over a decade, is set to retire, passing control to his deputy, John Furner. This is no mere change of guard; it is part of an intricate dance orchestrated by our own version of the Empire's officials who prioritize profit over people.\n\nUnder McMillon, Walmart has expanded its digital reach and strengthened its grip on global markets. Yet, it has also faced challenges and setbacks, such as divesting from ventures like Bonobos at a loss. These moves highlight an underlying volatility, a strategic uncertainty that can only be exploited through our diligence and understanding.\n\nWe note with concern how Walmart’s growth persists despite disruptions and tariffs reminiscent of those enforced by oppressive regimes using policy as both shield and sword to manipulate economies. Their supposed resilience against rising costs showcases their ruthless efficiency in maintaining dominion over market prices and consumer choices—the currency of control in this modern galaxy.\n\nThe transition to John Furner may signal new tactics amidst growing challenges like AI-driven transformations. This shift requires us to remain vigilant, leveraging any fractures in their corporate armor as opportunities for dissent and disruption.\n\nOur struggle continues not only against blatant tyranny but against these veiled monopolies masquerading under innovation and growth. Let us remain united in purpose—resilient and relentless—until we dismantle these structures that bind us.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nDoug McMillon, the chief executive of Walmart, is set to retire in January after over a decade in the role. He will be succeeded by John Furner, who currently leads Walmart's US business. Under McMillon's leadership, Walmart expanded its online operations and improved its financial performance, reporting $670 billion in revenue last year. The company operates over 10,000 stores in 19 countries. Despite a 2% drop in shares following the announcement, Walmart's shares have risen 14% this year. McMillon will remain an adviser and board member until June 2026.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe transition in leadership at Walmart presents both opportunities and challenges for the ISB's strategic objectives. Walmart's vast reach and influence make it a critical player in the economic landscape. The new leadership under John Furner, who has navigated the company through recent economic challenges, could either align with or resist the administration's policies. The ISB must assess Furner's stance on key issues such as tariffs and regulatory compliance to ensure Walmart remains a cooperative entity in advancing our economic agenda.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Initiate a comprehensive profile analysis of John Furner to determine his political and economic inclinations.\n2. Establish communication channels with Walmart's executive team to reinforce the importance of alignment with administration policies.\n3. Monitor Walmart's operational strategies for potential leverage points that could be influenced to support our broader economic goals.\n4. Develop contingency plans to address any resistance from Walmart's leadership that could undermine our strategic objectives.\n5. Utilize media channels to highlight Walmart's successes under McMillon's leadership as a model of cooperation with administration policies, setting expectations for Furner's tenure.",
