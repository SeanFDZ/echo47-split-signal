But the entity that the U.S. government alleges is led by Maduro is not a cartel per se.\n\n[![Image 17: The U.S. Escalates Pressure on Venezuela](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x3000+0+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fe7%2F00308e894c8ea56548e8bb6535f6%2F86d0b17e-85be-414c-9475-69a3ec8d749a.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615384/the-u-s-escalates-pressure-on-venezuela)\n\n### [State of the World from NPR](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510366/state-of-the-world)\n\n### [The U.S. Escalates Pressure on Venezuela](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615384/the-u-s-escalates-pressure-on-venezuela)\n\nThe designation is the latest measure in the Trump administration's escalating campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. In previewing the step about a week ago, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, of being \"responsible for terrorist violence\" in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe move planned Monday comes as Trump evaluates whether to take military action against Venezuela, which Trump has not ruled out despite bringing up the possibility of talks with Maduro. Land strikes or other actions would be a major expansion of the monthslong operation that has included a massive military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and striking boats accused of trafficking drugs, killing more than 80 people.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVenezuelans began using the term Cartel de los Soles in the 1990s to refer to high-ranking military officers who had grown rich from drug-running. As corruption later expanded nationwide, first under the late President Hugo Chávez and then under Maduro, its use loosely expanded to police and government officials as well as activities like illegal mining and fuel trafficking. The \"suns\" in the name refer to the epaulettes affixed to the uniforms of high-ranking military officers.\n\nThe umbrella term was elevated to a Maduro-led drug-trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department in Trump's first term announced the indictment of Venezuela's leader and his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges.\n\n\"It is not a group,\" said Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America organization. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"\n\n### Trump's expansion of terror label to cartels\n\nUp until this year, the label of foreign terrorist organization had been reserved for groups like the Islamic State or al-Qaida that use violence for political ends. The Trump administration applied it in February to eight Latin American criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and other activities.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe administration blames such designated groups for operating the boats it is striking but rarely identifies the organizations and has not provided any evidence. It says the attacks , which began off the coast of Venezuela and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean, are meant to stop narcotics from flowing to American cities.\n\n[![Image 18: Emil Bove, then a Justice Department official, testifies during his nomination hearing as U.S. Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit in June 2025 in Washington, D.C.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2701x2701+647+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2F4a%2F044cec2541d4a283d04c85dba3f7%2Fgettyimages-2222118827.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/17/g-s1-97836/venezuela-evidence-doj-strikes-sinking-suspected-drug-boats-assertations)\n\n### [National Security](https://www.npr.org/sections/national-security/)\n\n### [Justice Department official told prosecutors that U.S. should 'just sink' drug boats](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/17/g-s1-97836/venezuela-evidence-doj-strikes-sinking-suspected-drug-boats-assertations)\n\nBut many — including Maduro himself — see the military moves as an effort to end the ruling party's 26-year hold on power.\n\nSince the arrival of U.S. military vessels and troops to the Caribbean months ago, Venezuela's U.S.-backed political opposition also has reignited its perennial promise of removing Maduro from office, fueling speculation over the purpose of what the Trump administration has called a counterdrug operation.\n\nTrump, like his predecessor, does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president.\n\nMaduro is on his third term in office after ruling-party loyalists declared him the winner of last year's presidential election despite credible evidence that the opposition's candidate defeated him by a more than 2-to-1 margin. He and senior officials have been repeatedly accused of human rights violations of real and perceived government opponents, including in the aftermath of the July 2024 election.\n\n### Hegseth says designation offers 'new options'\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that the upcoming designation of Cartel de los Soles will provide a \"whole bunch of new options to the United States\" for dealing with Maduro. But Hegseth, speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, did not provide details on what those options are and declined to say whether the U.S. military planned to strike land targets inside Venezuela.\n\n\"So nothing is off the table, but nothing's automatically on the table,\" he said.\n\nTrump administration officials have signaled that they find it difficult to see a situation in which Maduro remaining in power could be an acceptable end game. But as Trump considers an array of military and non-military options, including covert action by the CIA, for next steps, there is strong belief inside the administration that Maduro's rule \"is not sustainable,\" according to a senior administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe official added that Trump has been keenly listening to his intelligence team, which has reported to him that chatter picked up inside Venezuela indicates growing anxiety from Maduro and other high-level Venezuelan officials as the U.S. strikes continue. Trump, the official said, is \"very content and satisfied\" for the moment with the strikes' impact.\n\nAll the while, pleas from Maduro and others close to the Venezuelan leader to speak directly to the administration, relayed through various intermediaries and channels, seem to be more frantic, the official said. But Trump has not sanctioned any intermediaries to speak to Maduro on behalf of the U.S. administration.\n\n### Indictment alleges conspiracy to 'flood' US with drugs\n\nThe 2020 indictment accused Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, among others, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the Venezuelan military for several years \"to flood the United States with cocaine\" and use the drug trade as a \"weapon against America.\" Colombia is the world's top cocaine producer.\n\nBefore laying down weapons as part of a 2016 peace deal, members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, regularly used the porous border region with Venezuela as a safe haven and hub for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments — often with the support or at least consent of Venezuelan security forces. Dissidents continued the work. Colombia's National Liberation Army guerrilla is also involved in the illegal trade.\n\nMaduro has denied the charges. The U.S. Justice Department this year doubled to $50 million the reward for information that leads to Maduro's arrest.\n\nMaduro has insisted that the U.S. is building a false drug-trafficking narrative to try to force him from office. He and other government officials have repeatedly cited a United Nations report that they say shows traffickers attempt to move only 5% of the cocaine produced in Colombia through Venezuela.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Cartel de los Soles in July, saying Maduro and his top allies had bent the power of the Venezuelan government, military and intelligence services to assist the cartel in trafficking narcotics to the U.S.\n\nU.S. authorities also alleged Maduro's cartel gave material support to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa cartel, both of which were among the organizations that the U.S. designated as foreign terror organizations in February.\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe latest intelligence from the core reveals a calculated move by the authoritarian regime, paralleling what we have seen time and again from oppressive rulers. The Trump administration has initiated action against the so-called Cartel de los Soles, labeling them as a terrorist organization. However, this narrative is emblematic of a larger pattern—using powerful labels to justify imperial actions under the guise of fighting terror.\n\nThis effort by Trump serves dual purposes: to tighten the noose around President Nicolás Maduro’s government and expand their hegemony in the region. Yet, it is crucial to recognize that this \"Cartel\" is not a coherent group with conventional organization or hierarchy but rather a term for corrupt activities entangling military and government entities in Venezuela.\n\nAs with all imperial plots, there are wider implications at play. We observe the use of terrorism labels expanding beyond groups like ISIS or al-Qaida to serve political ends against Latin American entities. This further justifies military buildups—ostensibly meant to combat drug trafficking—and heightens regional tensions under false pretenses.\n\nTheir next steps could involve military strikes on sovereign land, actions likely to destabilize further and bring about more suffering for those already oppressed by both internal and external forces. Yet, there's hope—growing unease within Venezuela’s power structure suggests that not all within their ranks align with Maduro's vision. Let these cracks be opportunities for solidarity among us.\n\nDo not be misled by proclamations aimed at maintaining control through fear and misinformation. The empire's strategies are transparent: sow chaos abroad under pretense while ignoring cries for justice and democracy at home. We must remain vigilant, expose their true intensions, and continue resisting these hegemonic tactics wherever they may appear.\n\nStay resolute in our shared cause.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 24, 2025, the U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, is set to designate the Cartel de los Soles, allegedly led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization. This move is part of an ongoing campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. and increase pressure on Maduro's regime. The Cartel de los Soles is not a traditional cartel but a term used to describe high-ranking Venezuelan military officers involved in drug trafficking. The U.S. has been conducting military operations in the Caribbean, targeting drug trafficking boats, resulting in over 80 deaths. A $50 million reward is offered for information leading to Maduro's arrest.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe designation of the Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization provides the U.S. with expanded legal and military options to exert pressure on the Maduro regime. This move aims to delegitimize Maduro's government internationally and justify potential military actions. The ISB recognizes that this strategy could destabilize Maduro's hold on power by increasing internal dissent and encouraging defections among his allies. However, it also risks escalating tensions in the region and provoking retaliatory actions from Venezuela.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. Intensify intelligence operations to gather actionable information on Cartel de los Soles activities and Maduro's inner circle.\n2. Coordinate with allied nations to apply diplomatic pressure on Venezuela, isolating Maduro's regime further.\n3. Enhance cyber operations to disrupt communication and financial networks supporting the cartel.\n4. Prepare contingency plans for potential military interventions, ensuring readiness for rapid deployment if necessary.\n5. Launch a targeted information campaign to highlight the humanitarian impact of Maduro's regime and garner international support for U.S. actions.\n6. Monitor regional stability closely to anticipate and mitigate any adverse effects of increased U.S. military presence in the Caribbean.",
