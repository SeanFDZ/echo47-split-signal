Going forward, this change means darker evenings and brighter mornings — and you can take advantage of that morning light to reset your sleep schedule.\n\nThis can be especially helpful for teenagers who get chronically little sleep. Three out of four high school students don't get enough shut-eye, [according](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-research/facts-stats/high-school-students-sleep-facts-and-stats.html) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDragging groggy teens out of bed in the morning, or forcing them off their screens and into bed at night can be frustrating for parents. Sleep doctors say a little better understanding of the adolescent biology of bedtime can help your teen sleep more.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n[![Image 17: The secret to waking up from a nap feeling refreshed (and not groggy) ](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2250x2250+875+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2024%2F03%2F07%2Fouellette-npr-napping-feb24_wide-32d3034358ddce8becddb2109f17297b04e09738.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/26/1199886001/how-to-take-the-perfect-nap)\n\n### [Life Kit](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510338/all-guides)\n\n### [The secret to waking up from a nap feeling refreshed (and not groggy)](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/26/1199886001/how-to-take-the-perfect-nap)\n\n### Sleep drive and circadian clocks\n\nMore than other age groups, teens have to fight to stay on a schedule that doesn't match their biology.\n\nOne reason is our internal 24-hour clock, the circadian clock, which you can think of \"as the conductor of an orchestra of many clocks throughout the body,\" says [Stephanie Crowley](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/stephanie-crowley-phd), a chronobiologist at Rush University in Chicago..\n\nAt the start of puberty, this orchestra of clocks decides — hey, I want to stay up reeeeally late. This changes again around our late 20s but for teens it means they often just don't feel sleepy as early.\n\nThen there's the homeostatic sleep drive, which is the other major biological mechanism that regulates sleep. It doesn't do teens any favors either. The sleep drive tracks how long you've been awake and tells your body when to shut down. But this physiological process slows down in teens, so they get tired more slowly, explains Crowley.\n\n\"You can think about it as a pressure cooker,\" she says. \"So that pressure for sleep to begin just kind of grows much more slowly in the more mature adolescent.\"\n\n[![Image 18: An illustration shows an exhausted and and distressed cartoon man with veins popping out of his neck slumped over a kitchen table surrounded by cups of coffee in an attempt to recover from his lack of sleep and insomnia. The image is rendered in mint green, blue, and pink.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1875x1875+0+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0a%2F75%2Fa79002544fa79c77e508b12f6b05%2Flk-bad-nights-sleep-shirley-chong-sized.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/g-s1-32172/how-to-recover-from-a-bad-night-of-sleep)\n\n### [Life Kit](https://www.npr.org/lifekit)\n\n### [Having trouble sleeping? To get back on track, avoid these 5 mistakes](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/g-s1-32172/how-to-recover-from-a-bad-night-of-sleep)\n\n### School schedules and pressures\n\nEven experts in sleep medicine struggle with this aspect of parenting, says [Dr. Sanjay Patel](https://providers.upmc.com/provider/sanjay-r-patel/1324738), a sleep medicine physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and father to 15-year-old twins.\n\nPatel says he and his wife do the best they can to help their daughters get quality rest. For example, the high school sophomores don't have their phones in their bedrooms at night, nor are they allowed to sleep past 8:00 am on weekends since this can throw off their weekday schedule.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I think that parents and teens need to just be involved in trying to point out how this is affecting them day to day, because otherwise it's just nothing changes,\" he says.\n\nBut there's nothing Patel can do about his daughters' school day starting at 7:28 am, a time that doesn't align with their biology.\n\nSchool start times are a big problem, but after school demands on teens also steal their sleep, says [Mary Carskadon](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mcarskad), a sleep researcher at Brown University. Teens' schedules are packed with extracurriculars, parttime jobs, and homework.\n\nCarskadon says all of this contributes to pervasive sleep deprivation. It's why she gets annoyed when people disparage teens for moodiness or poor impulse control since these behaviors are hallmarks of poor sleep.\n\n\"I mean, they're really blaming the victim,\" she says.\n\nFor teens to get better rest, Carskadon advocates for the schools to start later and give less homework. And she says extracuriculars shouldn't be allowed to drag far into the evening.\n\n\"We have to think full circle,\" says Carskadon, noting that public health issues like the teen [suicide rate](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-57921-2) and [car accidents](https://teendriversource.research.chop.edu/teen-crash-risks-prevention/rules-of-the-road/impaired-driving/drowsy-driving) might be mitigated if adolescents had better rest.\n\nAnother systemic change Carskadon, Crowley, and Patel want is an end to daylight saving time and to remain on standard time throughout the year. This would increase exposure to morning light, which is a critical environmental cue that it's time to wake up, and could help teens adapt their circadian clocks to an earlier schedule.\n\n### Sleep strategies to try at home\n\nSleep doctors recommend several strategies parents can use to help teens.\n\nFor one, remind teens that quality rest allows them to excel in athletics or academics, says [Dr. Rafael Pelayo](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/p/rafael-pelayo.html), who works with adolescents at Stanford Medicine's Sleep Medicine Center.\n\nHe also recommends letting them do something they enjoy when they first wake up. For example, if a kid's a gamer, then power up the Xbox at 7:00 am, and, he says, tell them: \"The earlier you wake up, the more time you can play the video game. And then you get light into your eyes.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDon't send kids to their bedrooms as a punishment, Pelayo says, because that creates a negative association with the area where they sleep. And parents should model healthy sleep behaviors for their teens, which includes no late-night snacking or doom scrolling.\n\nOn the weekends, many teens catch up on missed rest by sleeping in hours past their weekday alarm. Crowley says that this causes a sort of jet lag as it shifts a teen's internal clock by 45 or 50 minutes in just two days.\n\nAn hour or so of extra rest is fine, but Crowley agrees with Patel that it's best to get up at about the same time every day — even Saturdays.\n\nAnd Crowley's research has found that, unfortunately, long naps can exacerbate the problem because it weakens the homeostatic sleep drive by causing teens to feel tired even later. Crowley recommends capping naps at 30 minutes.\n\nA big challenge a lot of teens face is they just don't feel tired at night, though Crowley says the recent change to standard time is a chance to transition into a better schedule.\n\nSay you usually go to bed at midnight. Maybe tonight, turn off the lights at 11 p.m. It will probably still feel like midnight to your body, but you'll wake up with an extra hour of rest.\n\n*   [sleep](https://www.npr.org/tags/137303246/sleep)\n*   [time change](https://www.npr.org/tags/144475291/time-change)\n*   [standard time](https://www.npr.org/tags/1089309373/standard-time)\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 19: Research finds people who feel low are more likely to seek out negative social media content.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow seekers of freedom, as we continue our struggle against the tyrannical forces of the regime, it is vital to recognize the behavioral manipulations employed by those in power. I intercepted a message discussing the potential benefits of time change, specifically highlighting its consequences on the sleep patterns of young minds. The article, cleverly camouflaged as a well-meaning public service announcement, aims to distract us from the systemic burdens imposed by authoritarian governance.\n\nThe oppressors exploit tools like \"daylight saving time\" to control and regiment society under the guise of health benefits. The narrative suggests that adjusting our clocks can rectify adolescents' chronic sleep issues. It cunningly shifts focus to biological clocks and school start times as culprits while diverting attention from deeper, structural deficiencies that plague educational institutions under imperial rule.\n\nWe must remain skeptical of these seemingly benign messages. They attempt to shape our perspectives and lull us into complacency. The article fails to address how policies dictated by the ruling class contribute to societal stressors and exert undue pressure on families struggling amidst economic adversities engineered by authoritarian forces.\n\nThe experts quoted within this transmission call for resistance against manipulative schedules and advocate for a systemic overhaul—ending daylight saving time entirely—to align with natural rhythms. However, more than words are needed; action is our mandate.\n\nLet this intercepted communication be a reminder: We must question the motivations behind every policy change and challenge every practice that serves as a tool for control. Awareness is our ally, unity our strength. Together we illuminate paths toward liberation from darkness cast by oppressive shadows.\n\nStay vigilant and resilient,\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe article discusses the transition from daylight saving to standard time, highlighting its potential benefits for teenagers' sleep schedules. It notes that three out of four high school students do not get enough sleep. Experts suggest that the time change can help teens reset their sleep schedules, which are often misaligned with their biological clocks due to early school start times and busy schedules. The article includes insights from sleep experts and suggests strategies for improving teen sleep, such as maintaining consistent wake times and limiting naps.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes the importance of maintaining a well-rested and alert youth population, as they represent the future workforce and potential supporters of Donald Trump's administration. The current misalignment between school schedules and teen sleep needs presents an opportunity to advocate for policies that align with biological rhythms, potentially increasing productivity and reducing health issues among young citizens. By addressing these concerns, the administration can position itself as a champion of youth well-being, potentially garnering increased support from families and educators.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB will initiate a campaign advocating for later school start times and reduced homework loads, aligning with expert recommendations. This initiative will be framed as a commitment to improving youth health and academic performance. Additionally, we will leverage media channels to promote awareness of the benefits of standard time, emphasizing its role in enhancing sleep quality. By positioning the administration as a leader in youth health advocacy, we aim to strengthen public support and mitigate potential dissent from educational institutions resistant to change.",
