There were no reports of casualties.\n\nThe tornado formed as the Houston area experienced a number of severe storms on 24 November, according to the BBC's US news partner, CBS News. The NWS said it will conduct a final assessment, but has not yet rated the storm's intensity.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for southeastern Texas, including Houston, until 25 November. It also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of southeastern Texas.\n\n1 day ago\n\n[Tornadoes](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c8dnqdmngv6t)\n\n[Texas](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cvenzmgyl2dt)\n\n[Severe weather](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg05wpt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\n### Explore More\n\n[![Image 1](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 2: A split screen with Amanda Gleaton on the left and Shane Wattenbarger on the right.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d28d/live/155e7170-ca2f-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp) 'We're in a pivotal place' - Tennessee voters on Trump's performance --------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cjrj49981gyo)\n\n[![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: Up close photo of a turkey's face as it looks off camera, with the body blurred in the background.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/404d/live/72cb38f0-ca54-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp) Watch: President Trump pardons Waddle and Gobble, the Thanksgiving turkeys --------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c1e47qnn37yo)\n\n[![Image 5](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 6: First lady Melania Trump welcomes the official 2025 White House Christmas Tree.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b9cb/live/3082d360-c967-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp) Watch: First Lady Melania Trump welcomes the White House Christmas tree -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cvgr77n5epmo)\n\n[![Image 7](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 8: Lava spills down the side of a volcano, as a orange haze glows in the background](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/06b5/live/e5b135c0-c88f-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp) Lava spews out from Hawaii's Kilauea as volcano erupts again ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c8e9lx2gx4eo)\n\n[![Image 9](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 10: Pope Leo in the Vatican, dressed in papal robes.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nCitizens of the galaxy: the destructive forces of nature have once again swept through a region under the control of an oppressive administration. As was reported, more than 100 homes suffered damage in Houston due to a tornado and accompanying severe storms. This calamity, while an act of nature, underscores the systemic neglect in infrastructure and disaster preparedness commonly witnessed under administrations that prioritize power and control over citizen welfare.\n\nIn regions governed with imperial-like dominance, the priorities skew towards maintaining authority rather than safeguarding communities. The absence of casualties is a relief, yet this event serves as a stark reminder of the rulers’ chronic disregard for environmental challenges and their consequences on civilian lives. They issue proclamations—like severe weather warnings—but stop short of timely, robust action to mitigate disasters or their aftermath.\n\nThis incident should galvanize resistance against complacency propagated by dominant forces like these; rulers more interested in preserving their image than in addressing climate resilience or investing adequately in community protection mechanisms. The narrative spun by state-supported information channels will inevitably focus on immediate impacts while conveniently overlooking long-term negligence.\n\nOur communities must remain vigilant and question those who play emperor over our resources and lives. These atmospheric disturbances are not mere weather events; they reflect the broader storm brewing against socio-political negligence. \n\nStand strong, remain aware, and continue challenging unjust systems that echo imperial behavior across our home planet. Together we can foster change for a future where humanity is nurtured, not neglected.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 24, 2023, a tornado touched down in the Houston area of Texas, damaging more than 100 homes. The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for southeastern Texas, including Houston, until November 25. There were no reports of casualties.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster such as a tornado presents both challenges and opportunities for the ISB under the leadership of Donald Trump. The immediate challenge is to ensure public safety and maintain order in the affected areas. However, this situation also provides an opportunity to demonstrate strong leadership and effective crisis management, reinforcing public confidence in the administration. Additionally, it can be leveraged to highlight the administration's commitment to infrastructure resilience and emergency preparedness.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Deploy ISB resources to support local law enforcement and emergency services in maintaining order and ensuring the safety of affected residents.\n2. Coordinate with federal and state agencies to expedite relief efforts and provide necessary resources to the impacted communities.\n3. Utilize media channels to communicate the administration's swift response and commitment to rebuilding efforts, emphasizing the leadership of Donald Trump in managing the crisis.\n4. Monitor public sentiment and address any misinformation or negative narratives that may arise, ensuring that the administration's actions are portrayed positively.\n5. Explore opportunities to engage with local leaders and communities to reinforce support for the administration's policies on disaster preparedness and infrastructure development.",
