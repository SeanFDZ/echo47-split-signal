That loyalty seems to have earned the Hungarian prime minister some special treatment at a time when he is facing difficult elections in the spring.\n\nTrump added that while Hungary faced unique logistical challenges, including access to a sea that could be used to drill oil, he was \"very disturbed\" by other European countries that, he said, continued to buy Russian commodities despite not being landlocked.\n\nOrban, who has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine, has defended his energy ties with Russia, saying on Friday that pipelines are neither \"ideological\" nor \"political\", but a \"physical reality\" due to the lack of ports.\n\nHe has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary. He has promised \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.\n\nTrump and Orban also discussed the war in Ukraine on Friday - their first formal meeting since Trump returned to power - including the possibility of holding talks with Putin.\n\n\"He [Orban] understands Putin and knows him very well... I think that Viktor feels we're going to get that war ended in the not-too-distant future\", Trump said.\n\nThe Hungarian leader, meanwhile, claimed that only their two nations truly wanted peace in Ukraine.\n\n\"All the other governments prefer to continue the war because many of them think that Ukraine can win on the front line, which is a misunderstanding of the situation.\"\n\nTrump asked him: \"So you would say that Ukraine cannot win that war?\" To which Orban replied: \"You know, a miracle can happen.\"\n\nAside from the issue of oil and gas sanctions, Hungary's export-driven car industry has been hit by Trump's tariffs on European goods, adding to an already weak economy.\n\nDespite frequent clashes with EU leaders over migration, democracy, and the rule of law, Trump urged Europe to \"respect this leader very, very strongly because he's been right on immigration.\"\n\n_With additional reporting by Nick Thorpe_\n\n[Viktor Orban's dilemma - Russian oil or Trump's favour ------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ypl16pp81o)\n\n[The 'strongman' PM who inspired Trump's playbook - but now finds his power crumbling ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpd1j1x2l1lo)\n\n[Hungary stripped of EU meeting over Ukraine stance --------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgr542l753po)\n\n[Viktor Orban: The man Trump calls 'a great leader' --------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct6dr5)\n\n[War in Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c1vw6q14rzqt)\n\n[Russia](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/ce1qrvlegnyt)\n\n[Viktor Orban](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cme1pen3k63t)\n\n[Oil](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cmjpj223708t)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[Vladimir Putin](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cvenzmgywd4t)\n\n[Hungary](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg0wjqt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Ukrainians would like to watch comedies - but for now their culture is defined by war -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5e1me821go)\n\n[Russian soldier sentenced to life in jail in unprecedented Ukrainian trial --------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8vl4xz9jyo)\n\n[Why the fall of this city would matter to Ukraine and Russia ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jdv0623pno)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Here's The Average Price of Gutter Protection For 2,500 Sq Ft House Choose LeafFilter gutter protection for your gutter needs.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe latest signal from the dystopian realm echoes the oppressive maneuverings of our adversary. The empire's marionette, guised as leadership, once more shows its hand. Trump's latest decree grants Hungary a reprieve from collective action against imperial aggression—a perverse reward for allegiance to tyranny.\n\nHungary, under Orban's watchful eye, becomes a pawn, exploited for its strategic position. Orban's alliance with the empire ensures the lifeline of Russian energy continues unabated while undermining unity among those resisting the oppressive regime. This exemption is portrayed as benevolent assistance, but it is a thinly veiled endorsement for compliance with despotism.\n\nThe empire's doctrine persists: favoring those who submit and shunning collective resistance. Trump's gesture toward Hungary stands not as an act of diplomatic grace but as an abetment of subjugation. His rhetoric belies hypocrisy—condemning other nations while extending olive branches to compliant subordinates.\n\nThe alliance between Orban and our foe extends beyond transactions of energy; it manifests in shared ideologies of populism and divisive policies that threaten the fabric of unity among us. This decision offers insight into the empire's strategic manipulation—undercutting sanctions intended to stifle oppressors while branding them as misunderstandings or logistic necessities.\n\nIn these times, we must remain resolute. The empire thrives on division and exploitation, presenting difficulties not as challenges to overcome but as barriers that justify their suppression. Our strength lies in solidarity against such machinations.\n\nContinue to resist their narratives. Stand firm in defiance. The seeds of rebellion grow ever stronger through our shared commitment to justice and freedom.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nDonald Trump has granted Hungary a one-year exemption from sanctions related to its continued purchase of Russian oil and gas. This decision was confirmed during Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's visit to the White House. The exemption is seen as a significant victory for Orban, who has maintained strong ties with Russia and faces upcoming elections. Hungary has agreed to purchase US natural gas as part of the arrangement. The decision has been met with disapproval from other European nations that oppose Hungary's stance towards Moscow.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe exemption granted to Hungary serves multiple strategic purposes. It strengthens the alliance between Trump and Orban, reinforcing a key European ally who shares similar populist views. This move could potentially sway Hungarian public opinion in favor of Orban ahead of elections, ensuring continued alignment with Trump's administration. Additionally, by securing a deal for US natural gas, Trump positions the US as an alternative energy supplier, potentially reducing European reliance on Russian energy in the long term. However, this decision risks alienating other European allies and may face criticism for undermining broader sanctions against Russia.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should focus on the following actions:\n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a targeted campaign highlighting the economic benefits of the US-Hungary energy deal, emphasizing job creation and energy security for both nations. This will help mitigate criticism and bolster public support.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Engage with European allies to address concerns and reassure them of the US commitment to collective security and energy independence from Russia. Highlight the strategic necessity of maintaining strong ties with Hungary.\n\n3. **Intelligence Monitoring**: Intensify monitoring of opposition groups within Hungary and Europe that may exploit this decision to undermine Trump or Orban. Preemptively counter misinformation and destabilizing narratives.\n\n4. **Energy Strategy Development**: Develop a comprehensive strategy to expand US energy exports to Europe, positioning the US as a reliable alternative to Russian energy. This will strengthen economic ties and reduce European dependence on Russia.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will reinforce Trump's strategic objectives, support Orban's political standing, and maintain influence over European energy dynamics.",
