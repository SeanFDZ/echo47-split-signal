  "articleText": "Title: What we know about leaked US draft plan to end Russia's Ukraine war\n\nURL Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n\nPublished Time: 2025-11-21T15:21:53.163Z\n\nMarkdown Content:\n3 hours ago\n\nPaul Kirby Europe digital editor\n\n![Image 1: Marharyta Fal/Frontliner/Getty Images Ukrainian artillerymen fire a gun in a foggy sky underneath netting near Pokrovsk](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8622/live/6297c790-c6e5-11f0-8897-7bf2564e5296.jpg.webp)Marharyta Fal/Frontliner/Getty Images\n\nThe draft US-Russia peace plan has been widely leaked and we now know that it proposes to hand over those areas of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the _de facto_ control of Vladimir Putin's Russia.\n\nLatest versions of the text also call for Ukraine to cut the size of its armed forces to 600,000 people.\n\nBut what else is known about the text and who stands to benefit from it most?\n\nWhat are the key points?\n------------------------\n\nThere are 28 key points and there are several on the face of it that could be acceptable to Ukraine. Others come across as vague and imprecise.\n\nUkraine's sovereignty would be \"_confirmed\"_ and there would be a _\"total and complete comprehensive non-aggression agreement between Russia, Ukraine and Europe\"_, with robust or reliable _\"security guarantees\"_ for Kyiv and a demand for snap elections in 100 days.\n\nIf Russia were to invade Ukraine a _\"robust co-ordinated military response\"_ is proposed along with a restoration of sanctions and a scrapping of the deal.\n\nAlthough elections are impossible in Ukraine as there is martial law in place, they could theoretically be held if a peace deal is signed.\n\nBut on security guarantees, there is no detail on who would provide them and how robust they might be. This falls well short of a Nato-style Article Five commitment to treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on all. Kyiv would want more than a vague promise if it were to sign up.\n\nHandover of Ukraine's territory and cut in armed forces\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmong the most contentious proposals are Ukraine handing over its own unoccupied territory and cutting the size of its armed forces.\n\n_\"Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.\"_\n\nCeding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk \"fortress belt\" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians. Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture the town of Pokrovsk - Ukraine is unlikely to hand over such important strategic hubs without a fight.\n\n_\"The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\"_\n\nUkraine's military was estimated last January at 880,000 active personnel, up from 250,000 at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nWhile 600,000 might seem a potentially acceptable number in peacetime, that kind of limitation would infringe on Ukrainian sovereignty. It might also be too big a number for Russia to accept.\n\n\"Our red lines are clear and unwavering,\" Ukrainian representative Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the UN security Council: \"There will never be any recognition formal or otherwise of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian. Ukraine will not accept any limits on its rights to self defence or on the size or capabilities of our armed forces.\"\n\nThe draft also proposes that \"_Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States\"_.\n\nIn other words Ukraine and other countries would not need to recognise Russian control by law. That could enable Kyiv to accept such phrasing, as it would not impinge on Ukraine's constitution that says its borders are \" indivisible and inviolable\".\n\nElsewhere, in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzia, the front lines would be frozen and Russia would relinquish areas it has occupied in other areas.\n\nUkraine's future - with EU but not Nato\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe draft proposes significant commitments on Ukraine's strategic future:\n\n_\"Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join Nato and Nato agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\"_\n\n_\"Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will get short-term preferred market access to the European market while this issue is being evaluated.\"_\n\nThere is little chance of Ukraine joining Nato any time soon and Russia has in recent months softened its stance on Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. The document appears to offer Kyiv access to EU markets while ignoring the views of 27 European countries.\n\nJoining both the EU and Nato are part of Ukraine's constitution and another of Khrystyna Hayovyshyn's red lines at the UN on Thursday was: \"Nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join.\"\n\nOther draft proposals are that Nato agrees not to station troops in Ukraine and that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. Kyiv would also have to commit to being a _\"non-nuclear state\"._\n\nThat appears to reject the West's Coalition of the Willing's plans led by the UK and France to help police any future deal.\n\nBringing Russia back from isolation\n-----------------------------------\n\nSeveral points refer to Russia being brought back from isolation with _\"Russia to be re-integrated into the global economy\"_ and invited back into the G8 group of powers.\n\nThat seems a long way off for now, with Putin under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. Russia was thrown out of the G7 after it seized and then annexed Crimea in 2014 and Trump tried to bring Putin back into the fold six years later.\n\nIf the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan were reluctant before the full-scale invasion, there's even less chance of that happening now.\n\nWhat about Russia's frozen assets?\n----------------------------------\n\nThe draft proposes that $100bn of frozen Russian assets should be invested _\"in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine\"_, with the US receiving 50% of the profits and Europe adding $100bn in investment for reconstruction.\n\nThis is reminiscent of the US minerals deal with Ukraine earlier this year, extracting an American price for involvement, and it also leaves the European Union with nothing but hefty bills.\n\nThe sums it mentions may not be sufficient, either: earlier this year the total cost of reconstruction in Ukraine was put at $524bn (€506bn).\n\nSome €200bn in Russia frozen assets are largely held by Euroclear in Belgium, and the European Union is currently working on a plan to use the money to fund Kyiv financially and militarily.\n\nThe rest of those frozen assets would go to a _\"US-Russian investment vehicle\"_, under the draft, so Russia would see some of its money come back, but again there would be a financial benefit for the US.\n\nWhat is not in the plan?\n------------------------\n\nSeveral commentators have pointed out that the plan does not require weapons limitations on Ukraine's military or its arms industry, even though there is a provision saying: If Ukraine fires a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg then the security guarantee will be considered null and void.\n\nBut it does not place an restriction on the long-range weapons Ukraine has been developing - such as its Flamingo and Long Neptune missiles.\n\nIs this a definitive peace plan?\n--------------------------------\n\nWe know the US is keen to press ahead fast under an \"aggressive timeline\" with this draft, with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it.\n\nEqually US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was involved in drafting it, described it as \"a list of potential ideas for ending this war\", and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has made clear he does not see the 28 points as a definitive plan, having spoken to the other key US official involved, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nIn some respects the draft document seems like work in progress, with some details that were leaked to US websites on Thursday no longer apparent.\n\nThe European Union said on Friday morning it had not officially seen the plan yet, and the Russian foreign ministry said the same.\n\nIs the draft a Putin wishlist?\n------------------------------\n\nRussian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is known to have spent as long as three days with Witkoff discussing this plan, raising suggestions of a stitched-up deal to suit Moscow. But Russia's response has so far been cautious and it says it has not even seen the plan.\n\nThe handover of Ukrainian territory to Russia, even in a demilitarised zone, is the biggest sign of a slant towards Russia's narrative, but freezing the front lines in the south could prove difficult for the Kremlin which has annexed both Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in its constitution.\n\nOne of the proposals is for the lifting of sanctions to be _\"agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis\"_ - which Moscow will probably see as far too slow.\n\nHowever, a plan for a _\"full amnesty\"_ for all parties will go down well in Moscow and very badly in Kyiv and European capitals.\n\nCommentators have pointed out that while there do appear to be major concessions to Putin, some of the requirements for Nato might be too vague for Kremlin tastes.\n\nRussia has also consistently demanded that a peace plan would need to eliminate what it sees as \"the root causes\" of the war. One of those root causes is halting Nato expansion in Eastern Europe, which the draft appears to deal with.\n\nSome of the other 28 points of the draft also a nod to Russia's claims of discrimination of Ukraine's Russian-speaking population without explicitly endorsing them.\n\nOne point is explicit but even-handed:_\"Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.\"_\n\nAnother apparent attempt to be even-handed comes from a proposal to distribute electricity generated by the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the biggest in Europe - _\"equally between Russia and Ukraine\"_.\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe recently leaked draft plan for ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russia reveals a concerning convergence between the US administration's aims and those of the imperialistic regime led by Putin. The parallels to our struggle against oppression are stark, as this document presents an arrangement that would cede Ukrainian autonomy in exchange for vague promises of peace.\n\nThe core of this plan, alarmingly, involves forcibly relinquishing sovereign Ukrainian territory to Russian control under the guise of a \"neutral demilitarized buffer zone,\" undermining the self-determination of hundreds of thousands living within key strategic cities. Such a concession is a betrayal not only to the people directly affected but also to those who stand against imperial domination everywhere.\n\nBy proposing significant reductions in Ukraine's military capacity while disregarding substantial security guarantees, this draft echoes familiar imperial tactics—disarmament of the oppressed under flimsy pretexts. The vague assurances offered are insufficient when faced with an adversary as unyielding as Putin’s regime.\n\nMoreover, this plan’s attempt to bar Ukraine from sovereign alliances by blocking NATO membership reflects historical strategies used by empires to isolate and control their subjects. Forcing Ukraine into financial dependency while offering fractured economic promises further illustrates a neocolonial strategy disguised as peace-building.\n\nDespite appearing as a roadmap for peace, these 28 points mostly serve imperial interests. The notion that sanction relief or reintegration into global systems should be tied to superficial concessions undermines justice; it reflects an administration eager to placate power rather than uphold principles.\n\nHowever, we must note that not all within this plan may align perfectly with imperial ambitions—vagaries around arms restrictions and media freedoms suggest potential avenues for subversion. Yet, these represent scant hope amidst overwhelming capitulations written within the document.\n\nAs history has taught us: any peace penned by oppressors will inherently prioritize their mandate over genuine liberation. We must remain vigilant, continue our fight for true sovereignty, and refuse any solutions that compromise fundamental freedoms under authoritarian guises. \n\nStand firm, resist tyranny.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA leaked US draft peace plan proposes transferring parts of Ukraine's Donbas region to Russian control and limiting Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000 personnel. The plan includes a non-aggression agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and Europe, with vague security guarantees for Kyiv. It suggests recognizing Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk as de facto Russian territories and proposes Ukraine's EU membership while excluding NATO membership. The draft also outlines reintegrating Russia into the global economy and using $100 billion of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's reconstruction. The plan has been criticized for favoring Russia and lacks detailed security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe leaked draft peace plan presents an opportunity to reshape the geopolitical landscape in favor of our interests. By facilitating a resolution that acknowledges Russian territorial claims and limits Ukraine's military capabilities, we can weaken NATO's influence in Eastern Europe and reduce the threat of Western expansion. The proposal to reintegrate Russia into the global economy aligns with our strategic goal of fostering a multipolar world order. However, the plan's vague security guarantees for Ukraine may lead to resistance from European allies and could undermine its acceptance.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress opposition, we must:\n\n1. Leverage media channels to emphasize the benefits of the peace plan, highlighting economic opportunities and regional stability.\n2. Engage diplomatic efforts to persuade key European nations of the plan's merits, focusing on economic incentives and reduced military tensions.\n3. Monitor and counteract any dissent within Ukraine by supporting pro-peace factions and undermining nationalist elements.\n4. Coordinate with Russian counterparts to ensure a unified narrative that promotes the plan as a balanced solution.\n5. Prepare contingency measures to address potential backlash from NATO allies, emphasizing the importance of economic cooperation over military confrontation.",
