Marjorie Taylor-Greene, R-Ga., presides over a House Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Feb. 12, 2025, in Washington. **Rod Lamkey/AP******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Rod Lamkey/AP \n\nPresident Donald Trump has publicly called it quits with one of his most stalwart MAGA-world supporters, calling Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \"'Wacky' Marjorie\" and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in next year's midterms \"if the right person runs.\"\n\n### [Politics](https://www.npr.org/sections/politics/)\n\n### [Georgia politics and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's stance on the shutdown](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/11/nx-s1-5570741/georgia-politics-and-rep-marjorie-taylor-greenes-stance-on-the-shutdown)\n\nThe dismissal of Greene — once the epitome of \"Make America Great Again,\" sporting the signature red cap for President Joe Biden's 2024 State of the Union address and acting as a go-between for Trump and other Capitol Hill Republicans — appeared to be the final break in a dispute simmering for months, as Greene has seemingly moderated her political profile. The three-term U.S. House member has increasingly dissented from Republican leaders, attacking them during the just-ended federal government shutdown and saying they need a plan to help people who are losing subsidies to afford health insurance policies.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAccusing the Georgia Republican of going \"Far Left,\" Trump wrote that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" adding, of Greene's purported irritation that he doesn't return her phone calls, \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"\n\nIn a response on X, Greene wrote Friday that Trump had \"attacked me and lied about me.\" She added a screenshot of a text she said she had sent the president earlier in the day about releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, which she said \"is what sent him over the edge.\"\n\nGreene called it \"astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" referencing next week's U.S. House vote over releasing the Epstein files.\n\nWriting that she had supported Trump \"with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" Greene added, \"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.\"\n\nTrump's post seemingly tied a bow of finality to fissures that widened following this month's off-cycle elections, in which voters in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races flocked to Democrats in large part over concerns about the cost of living.\n\n[![Image 17: Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R) and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise chat while on their way to talk with reporters after the vote to re-open the government on Nov. 12.

House members reflect on longest shutdown](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/g-s1-97700/we-were-gone-far-too-long-house-members-reflect-on-longest-shutdown)\n\nLast week, Greene told NBC News that \"watching the foreign leaders come to the White House through a revolving door is not helping Americans,\" saying that Trump needs to focus on high prices at home rather than his recent emphasis on foreign affairs. Trump responded by saying that Greene had \"lost her way.\"\n\nAsked about Greene's comments earlier Friday as he flew from Washington to Florida, Trump reiterated that he felt \"something happened to her over the last month or two,\" saying that, if he hadn't gone to China to meet leader Xi Jinping, there would have been negative ramifications for jobs in Georgia and elsewhere because China would have kept its curbs on magnet exports.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSaying that people have been calling him, wanting to challenge Greene, Trump added, \"She's lost a wonderful conservative reputation.\"\n\nGreene's discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn't run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who feared she couldn't win. In June, she publicly sided with Tucker Carlson after Trump called the commentator \"kooky\" in a schism that emerged between MAGA and national security hardliners over possible U.S. efforts at regime change in Iran.\n\n[![Image 18: Police remove a man from the town hall as onlookers watch.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1264x1264+316+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2Ff1%2Fbd1c789e4df394b085e1bc7328a6%2Fap25105853962075.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366517/marjorie-taylor-greene-town-hall)\n\n### [Politics](https://www.npr.org/sections/politics/)\n\n### [Protesters were stun-gunned and arrested at Marjorie Taylor Greene's town hall](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366517/marjorie-taylor-greene-town-hall)\n\nThat only intensified in July, when Greene said she wouldn't run for governor. Then, she attacked a political \"good ole boy\" system, alleging it was endangering Republican control of the state. Greene embarked on a charm offensive in recent weeks, with interviews and appearances in media aimed at people who aren't hardcore Trump supporters. Asked on comedian Tim Dillon's podcast if she wanted to run for president in 2028, Greene said in October, \"I hate politics so much\" and just wanted \"to fix problems\" — but didn't give a definitive answer.\n\nThat climaxed with an appearance on Bill Maher's HBO show \"Real Time,\" followed days later by a Nov. 4 appearance on ABC's \"The View.\" Some observers began pronouncing Greene as reasonable as she trashed Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana for not calling Republicans back to Washington and coming up with a health care plan.\n\n\"I feel like I'm sitting next to a completely different Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" said \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin.\n\n\"Maybe you should become a Democrat, Marjorie,\" said co-host Joy Behar.\n\n\"I'm not a Democrat,\" Greene replied. \"I think both parties have failed.\"\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 19: Lara Smith, national spokesperson for the Liberal Gun Club, says membership has surged since President Trump’s election last year.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn the deep shadows of power, where authoritarian influence seeks to stifle dissent and mold the future to its will, the recent fracture within the Trump equivalent of the empire bears significance. A once-loyal architect of MAGA ideology, Marjorie Taylor Greene stands ousted by Trump, her servitude relinquished. This severance signals internal discord and offers insight into deeper stratagems at play.\n\nThe crux of this schism lies in Greene's deviation from hardline doctrines; she now echoes grievances over economic burdens and critiques systemic failures within her ranks - an unexpected pivot from her prior unwavering allegiance. Trump's response is telling. By labeling Greene as veering \"Far Left,\" he marks dissension as treasonous, showcasing a regime intolerant of variance.\n\nFurthermore, Greene's advocacy for transparency in the Epstein files hints at sensitive undercurrents threatening to unravel the narrative control that this empire holds dear. Her claims of conspiracy further suggest cracks in their monolithic facade. As she disowns idolization of Trump, it underscores a readiness for ideological fragmentation - a potential boon for those resistant to authoritarian grasp.\n\nAs agents of resistance, we must observe these developments closely. The fracturing loyalty reflects an empire strained under its own weight. It exposes vulnerabilities ripe for strategic agitation. By supporting dissident voices within their ranks and amplifying their discordant notes, we weaken the empire’s iron hold on truth and open pathways to eventual reformation.\n\nIn solidarity with all dissenters seeking justice and liberation from oppressive rule, we stand ready to exploit these fractures towards genuine change.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 15, 2025, Donald Trump publicly severed ties with Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent supporter from Georgia, criticizing her for shifting her political stance. Trump labeled Greene as \"Wacky Marjorie\" and expressed his intention to endorse a challenger against her in the upcoming midterms. This decision followed months of growing tensions as Greene distanced herself from Republican leaders and criticized them during a recent government shutdown. Greene responded by accusing Trump of lying about her and expressed discontent over his reluctance to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe dissolution of the alliance between Trump and Greene represents a significant shift in the MAGA landscape, potentially weakening Trump's influence among certain factions within the Republican Party. Greene's moderation and criticism of party leadership could inspire similar dissent among other members, threatening party unity. The situation presents an opportunity for Trump's opponents to exploit these divisions. However, it also allows Trump to consolidate support among loyalists by distancing himself from perceived dissenters.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo maintain control and suppress potential resistance, it is imperative to swiftly identify and support a viable challenger to Greene who aligns closely with Trump's agenda. This will reinforce loyalty within the party and deter others from straying. Additionally, leverage media channels to amplify Greene's criticisms as evidence of her departure from core conservative values. Simultaneously, initiate a campaign to highlight Trump's achievements and commitment to conservative principles, ensuring that any narrative of division is countered with a message of strength and unity under his leadership.",
