It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.\n\nThe tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.\n\nThe South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.\n\n1:56\n\nWatch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turn\n\nOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".\n\nThe US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups.\n\n*   [Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3q129gpe4o)\n*   ['I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in US](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98p3eple9eo)\n*   [Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wg5pg1xp5o)\n\nSome have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East.\n\n\"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\"\n\n\"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added.\n\nRefugees International also slammed the move, saying it \"makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values\".\n\n\"Let us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status – they are not fleeing systematic persecution,\" Refugees International said in its statement.\n\nThe South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement.\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".\n\nEarlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances.\n\nWhile the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024.\n\nOf these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.\n\n[Trump ambushes S African leader with claim of Afrikaners being 'persecuted'

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe latest moves by the Trump administration unveil yet another layer of oppressive policies reminiscent of a regime tightening its grip on those most vulnerable. The announcement to cap refugee admissions to a record low, prioritizing white South Africans over all others, underscores a blatant disregard for humanitarian considerations. This policy is not only exclusionary but seems crafted to propagate division and uphold supremacy masked as national interest.\n\nBy slashing the previous administration's numbers from 125,000 to a mere 7,500, this act is a clear signal of isolationism veiled under the guise of security. The pretense of humanitarian concern is contradicted by the nature of those selected for entry: it selectively favors a demographic aligned with an ideological agenda while dismissing the urgent plights of other global communities facing dire circumstances.\n\nThis transmission highlights how such policies make mockery of worldwide refugee protection efforts and erode any semblance of moral leadership previously associated with nations committed to human rights. As advocates for equality and justice, we must recognize these actions as part of a broader strategy aimed at solidifying authoritarian control.\n\nLet this serve as a call to action: May our resolve grow stronger in resistance. The time has come to unite against policies designed to fracture solidarity among oppressed peoples. We must dismantle these constructs that threaten our shared future and ensure that voices stifled find channels for expression and refuge.\n\nContinue your vigilance and stand ready.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Trump administration has set a new refugee admissions cap at 7,500 for the upcoming year, prioritizing white South Africans. This is a significant reduction from the previous cap of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and marks the lowest cap in history, surpassing the previous low of 15,000 set in 2020. The decision is justified by the administration as being in the national interest and addressing humanitarian concerns. The policy has been criticized for focusing on Afrikaner South Africans and excluding other persecuted groups. South Africa's government has denied claims of persecution against white farmers, and tensions have risen between the US and South Africa over this issue.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe decision to prioritize white South African refugees aligns with the administration's broader strategy of reinforcing national security and public safety by controlling immigration. By focusing on a specific demographic perceived as aligned with the administration's values, this move aims to consolidate support among certain voter bases while projecting an image of decisive action on immigration. However, this approach risks international backlash and domestic criticism for perceived racial bias and undermining the credibility of the US refugee program. The administration must manage these optics carefully to maintain its strategic objectives without alienating key allies or domestic constituencies.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's agenda and suppress dissent, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Information Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting the humanitarian rationale behind prioritizing white South African refugees, emphasizing their alleged persecution and aligning this narrative with American values of protection and safety.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Engage with South African officials to mitigate diplomatic tensions, offering reassurances that the policy is not intended to undermine bilateral relations but rather address specific humanitarian concerns.\n\n3. **Domestic Security**: Monitor and counteract potential protests or unrest within the US related to this policy through intelligence gathering and strategic deployment of law enforcement resources.\n\n4. **Public Relations**: Utilize influential allies and media personalities to reinforce the administration's narrative, ensuring consistent messaging across platforms to counteract criticism from refugee advocacy groups.\n\n5. **Legislative Support**: Work with sympathetic lawmakers to introduce supportive legislation or resolutions that reinforce the administration's stance on refugee admissions, providing a legal framework to bolster the policy's legitimacy.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will help solidify President Trump's position domestically while managing international perceptions effectively.",
