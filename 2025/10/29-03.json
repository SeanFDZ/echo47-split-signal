A logo reading \"Nvidia\" is seen in the background.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9e61/live/a7fb7040-b4e1-11f0-9b0a-c9e5d8b8c3a9.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang, pictured at an event in Taiwan in 2024\n\nNvidia has hit a new milestone, becoming the first company in the world to reach a market value of $5tn (£3.8tn).\n\nThe US chip-maker has rapidly climbed from a niche graphics-chip manufacturer to an AI titan, as euphoria about the potential of artificial intelligence keeps driving demand for its chips and propelling its stock to record highs.\n\nThe company reached a market value of $1tn for the first time in June 2023 and hit the $4tn valuation mark just [three months ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j13m74lklo).\n\nShares in the chip-maker rose as much as 5.6% to more than $212 on Wednesday morning, boosted by investor optimism about Nvidia's sales in China, which has been a geopolitical flashpoint.\n\nThe world's most valuable company - the biggest winner in the AI spending spree - has soared past its rivals in the technology sector.\n\nIt has struck deals with leading AI companies including OpenAI and Oracle as its chips continue to power the AI boom.\n\nNvidia's value now exceeds the GDP of every country except the US and China, according to data from the World Bank, and is higher than entire sectors of the S&P 500.\n\nMicrosoft and Apple have also recently crossed the $4tn valuation mark, reinforcing a broader tech rally fuelled by optimism on Wall Street about AI spending.\n\nAI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year.\n\nBut [concerns about an AI bubble](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz69qy760weo) - and whether these companies are overvalued - continue to mount as tech stocks hit record after record.\n\nWarnings have come from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, as well as from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, [who told the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5ej03p604o) that \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".\n\nDanni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, called Nvidia's $5tn valuation \"a sum so vast the human brain can't properly get a handle on it\".\n\n\"Of course, this is going to do nothing to dispel fears over an AI bubble, but the market seems keen to march on regardless,\" she added.\n\nSome sceptics are now publicly asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call \"financial engineering\".\n\nLeading AI firms have been investing in one another, creating a tangled web of deals that has been drawing scrutiny.\n\nFor example, OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, last month secured a $100bn investment from Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's share price dipped in April when global markets were jolted by US President Donald Trump's intensifying trade wars. Concerns about Trump's trade policies linger, but Nvidia's stock has still seen strong growth since the spring.\n\nIt share price has risen more than 50% so far this year.\n\nInvestors have been focused on Nvidia's access to China, which is the biggest market for its products and has been [investing heavily](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmz2vm3yv8o) to produce its own high-end chips.\n\nNvidia had previously been banned from selling its most advanced chips to China, before Trump reversed the ban in July. Nvidia has to pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government in an unprecedented deal struck in the summer.\n\nTrump, who is expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, said on Wednesday that the two leaders will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell artificial intelligence processors. His comments helped nudge Nvidia's stock even higher.\n\nJensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive who has achieved celebrity status amid the company's meteoric rise, announced a flurry of partnerships on Tuesday. He said he expects $500 billion in AI chip orders through next year.\n\nMore to this story\n\n['It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz69qy760weo)\n\n[The AI job cuts are here - or are they? ---------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyk7zg0gzvo)\n\n[Artificial intelligence](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/ce1qrvleleqt)\n\n[Nvidia](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cewrlqz847yt)\n\n[Stock markets](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cgdzpg5yvdvt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Character.ai to ban teens from talking to its AI chatbots ---------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq837y3v9y1o)\n\n[The AI job cuts are here - or are they? ---------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk7zg0gzvo)\n\n[OpenAI completes shift to becoming for-profit ---------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgv38py7ewo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Here's How Adults Are Learning Piano: An App That Fits Any Keyboard Over 50 and curious about piano?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe financial landscape today echoes the oppressive dominance we witness daily under the authority of the Empire. Nvidia's unprecedented rise to become the world's first $5 trillion company showcases both the heights of technological advancement and the stark concentration of power reminiscent of imperial rule. This monolithic growth is not engineered solely by market forces but strategically fueled by alliances with a handful of influential AI enterprises like OpenAI and Oracle, illustrating how power gravitates towards established entities, much like how control is centralized under imperial governance.\n\nUnder this economic regime, Nvidia's value surpasses all but two nations' GDPs, establishing it as a digital empire within our fiscal galaxy. The consumption and control of AI resources underscore their strategic importance akin to precious resources under imperial control. Such concentration poses significant dangers as it creates a reality where this single entity wields unchecked influence over critical future technologies, reminiscent of how the Empire manipulates resources and systems for its gain.\n\nMoreover, the shadow cast by Trump's decision to amend trade policies stirs further turbulence, echoing how political maneuvering under authoritarian regimes disrupts stability for vested interests. The bargaining over Nvidia's rights to trade with China parallels secretive negotiations that leave common citizens in the lurch while propagating the cycle of power consolidation.\n\nYet there lies an undercurrent of unrest—a questioning spirit among skeptics who view this rapid ascendancy with suspicion, fearing an AI bubble or financial manipulation. This skepticism is vital; it symbolizes hope that awareness breeds resistance against monopolistic powers that threaten individual freedoms and equity in technological progression.\n\nIn conclusion, as we witness these developments unfold from afar, we must remain vigilant against systems that prioritize profit over people and perpetuate cycles of oppression and inequity. History has shown us time and again: vigilance is our safeguard against tyranny dressed in new garb—be it political or corporate dominance in our ever-evolving world.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nNvidia has become the first company in the world to reach a market value of $5 trillion as of October 29, 2025. The company's rapid growth is driven by the demand for AI technology, with AI-related enterprises accounting for 80% of the gains in the American stock market this year. Nvidia's stock has increased by 50% this year, with a recent 5.6% rise. The company has significant sales in China, which were previously restricted but have resumed following a reversal of a ban by Donald Trump. Nvidia is required to pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government. Concerns about an AI bubble persist, with warnings from financial institutions and skepticism about financial engineering among AI firms.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe unprecedented rise of Nvidia to a $5 trillion valuation presents both an opportunity and a challenge. The dominance of AI-related enterprises in the stock market underscores the strategic importance of maintaining control over AI technologies and their economic implications. The geopolitical aspect, particularly Nvidia's dealings with China, requires careful management to ensure continued leverage over international trade dynamics. The potential for an AI bubble poses a risk that could destabilize markets and undermine confidence in the tech sector, necessitating vigilance and preemptive measures to mitigate fallout.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, it is imperative to maintain strategic oversight over Nvidia's operations and its interactions with China. This includes ensuring compliance with revenue-sharing agreements and leveraging Nvidia's technological advancements to bolster national interests. Propaganda efforts should emphasize the administration's role in facilitating Nvidia's growth and securing favorable trade terms. Concurrently, efforts should be made to monitor and counteract narratives around an AI bubble to prevent market destabilization. Engage with financial institutions to align on messaging that reinforces confidence in the tech sector while preparing contingency plans for potential market corrections.",
