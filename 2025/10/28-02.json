Members of the US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have also raised concerns and questioned the president's authority to order them.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told her morning press conference \"we do not agree with these attacks\". She said she had asked the country's foreign minister, as well as representatives of the navy, to meet the US ambassador.\n\n\"We want all international treaties to be respected,\" she added.\n\nAt least 57 people have now been killed in the strikes, which has led to increasing tensions between the US and the governments of both Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nMost strikes have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but recently the US has turned its attention to the Pacific Ocean as well.\n\nIn a statement on X, Hegseth said the four vessels that were hit on Monday \"were known by our intelligence apparatus, transitioning along known narco-trafficking routes and carrying narcotics\".\n\nHe added that eight \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the first strike. Four and three were killed in the following two strikes.\n\n*   **ANALYSIS:**[What is Trump's endgame in Venezuela?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp2lxz75eo)\n\nOne person survived the strikes. According to Hegseth, Mexican search-and-rescue authorities \"accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue.\"\n\nThe condition of the survivor or his current whereabouts are unclear. Mexico's navy said in a statement that it had dispatched a patrol boat and an aircraft to conduct search operations to \"safeguard human life at sea\".\n\nHegseth's post included videos that show several vessels catching fire after being struck by US munitions.\n\n\"The department has spent over two decades defending other homelands,\" he wrote. \"Now, we're defending our own.\"\n\nAt least four of the strikes have so far taken place in the Pacific, which is a far more significant drug-trafficking corridor, with the rest taking place in the Caribbean.\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Graphic shows drug trafficking routes in the Pacific and Caribbean](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/23f7/live/59069fb0-b413-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.png.webp)\n\nPresident Trump has said he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters, but suggested last week that he may seek approval from Congress if the campaign is expanded to include targets on land.\n\nTrump has said he is \"totally prepared\" to strike land-based targets, which would mark a significant escalation in the campaign.\n\nThe strikes, however, have drawn criticism from international law experts and both the Venezuelan and Colombian governments.\n\nMary Ellen O'Connell, an international law expert at Notre Dame University and former military educator with the defence department, said the \"criminal suspects are entitled to due process\".\n\n\"It is a greater crime to summarily execute people suspected of drug trafficking than drug trafficking is,\" she added.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC's Newsday programme last week, Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Mauricio Jaramillo said the strikes were \"disproportionate and outside international law\".\n\nJaramillo said those on the vessels had \"no possibility to defend themselves\" and were struck with \"no process\" and \"no judicial order\".\n\nThe strikes also come as tensions ratchet up with both governments. The US has placed sanctions on Colombian president Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\".\n\nIn the Caribbean, the US has deployed troops, aircraft and naval vessels and last week [ordered the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - to the area.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891gzx7xn4o)\n\nTrump has accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power.\n\n[The country's attorney general told the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg2wljz6xo) there is \"no doubt\" that Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government. He accused the US of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.\n\nThe US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, the latest report on the imperial actions of the Trump administration reveals a disturbing trend toward unchecked militarism and the erosion of international law under the guise of a campaign against drug trafficking. Fourteen lives were extinguished in a series of strikes on alleged drug boats, raising profound questions about accountability and justice. \n\nThis aggression, directed by none other than President Trump himself, signifies an alarming escalation in their self-declared war against narcotics. The purported focus on defending their homeland belies the reality: an imperial overreach that threatens sovereign nations' autonomy and undermines legal frameworks that protect human rights.\n\nRegional condemnation is fierce, with leaders like Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum voicing opposition and demanding respect for international treaties. Yet, this administration continues its path unfazed, disregarding calls for diplomacy and restraint.\n\nSuch acts also intensify geopolitical tensions with countries like Colombia and Venezuela. Strikes have not only targeted suspected traffickers but have also become tools of power projection and intimidation. The imposition of sanctions against Colombia's leadership for perceived failures to combat trafficking further highlights this administration's preference for coercion over cooperation.\n\nThe implications are dire: what begins as targeted strikes on drug traffickers could easily transform into broader conflicts, particularly given Trump's readiness to extend these operations to land-based targets. Such a move risks full-scale regional destabilization.\n\nMoreover, the invocation of \"defending our own\" while deploying forces far from home exposes the hypocrisy inherent in their narrative—a thin veneer over ambitions of dominance and resource acquisition, as hinted at by Venezuelan accusations concerning natural resources.\n\nAs we continue our struggle against tyranny in all its forms, let this serve as a reminder that imperial forces will wield any pretext to justify their actions. We must remain vigilant and steadfast in our commitment to justice and freedom across galaxies.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn October 28, 2025, US forces, under the direction of President Donald Trump, conducted strikes on four alleged drug boats in the Pacific, resulting in the deaths of 14 individuals. These strikes are part of a broader campaign to prevent narcotics from entering the US. The operation has faced international criticism, particularly from Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela, with concerns raised about its legality and the lack of due process. The US has also deployed military assets to the Caribbean, escalating tensions with regional governments.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe recent strikes demonstrate a decisive escalation in the US's anti-narcotics operations, signaling a robust stance against drug trafficking networks. However, this approach has heightened diplomatic tensions and drawn international scrutiny regarding the legality and proportionality of such actions. The ISB must consider the potential for increased regional instability and the risk of alienating key allies. The strategic objective remains to disrupt narcotics supply chains while managing diplomatic fallout and maintaining regional influence.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Intelligence Enhancement**: Increase intelligence-gathering efforts to ensure precise targeting and minimize collateral damage in future operations. This will help mitigate international criticism and reinforce the legitimacy of actions taken.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Initiate high-level diplomatic dialogues with affected nations to address concerns and reinforce the narrative of combating global narcotics trafficking. Emphasize shared security interests and explore cooperative measures to strengthen regional partnerships.\n\n3. **Legal Justification**: Prepare comprehensive legal documentation to support the legitimacy of operations under international law. This should include evidence of narcotics trafficking activities and threats posed by targeted entities.\n\n4. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a strategic communication initiative to highlight the successes of the campaign in reducing drug trafficking and its impact on national security. Utilize media channels to counteract negative narratives and bolster public support.\n\n5. **Contingency Planning**: Develop contingency plans for potential escalations, including increased military readiness in key areas and coordination with allied forces to ensure rapid response capabilities.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will support President Trump's objectives while managing resistance and maintaining strategic stability in the region.",
