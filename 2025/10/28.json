Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon said that a \"plan\" was in place to secure the 79-year-old president another term.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Japan from Malaysia, Trump said that while he would \"be allowed\" to run again as vice-president, he had no plans to do so.\n\n\"I think people wouldn't like that,\" he said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\"\n\nTalking about the possibility of a third term, Trump said: \"I haven't really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.\"\n\nAdditionally, Trump also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\".\n\n\"All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they don't,\" he added, referring to Democrats.\n\n*   [Can Trump serve a third term as US president?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20lwedn23o)\n\nThe 22nd amendment of the US constitution bars presidents from seeking a third term.\n\nRepealing the amendment would require approval from two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and then ratification by 38 of the 50 state legislatures - a process viewed as highly unlikely.\n\nLast week, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon - who remains a vocal supporter - claimed there was a \"plan\" to secure a third term for Trump.\n\n\"Trump is going to be president in '28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" Bannon told The Economist. \"At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is.\"\n\nIn March, Trump told CNBC he would \"probably not\" run again, though he later said he was \"not joking\" about the possibility.\n\nIt is still unclear which Democrats intend to run for the White House in 2028, although several have already expressed an interest.\n\nOn Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that he would \"be lying\" if he said he was not giving serious thought to a presidential bid.\n\nFormer vice-president [Kamala Harris also told the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo)she may run again and that she could \"possibly\" be president in the future.\n\n['I am not done' - Kamala Harris tells BBC she may run for president again -------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo)\n\n[Trump gives 'toothless' Asian summit its moment in the sun ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c797qlx93j0o)\n\n[US and China agree framework of trade deal ahead of Trump-Xi meeting --------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lqj5lz4geo)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[US politics](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Rare earths, Nobel nomination and cheers: Trump ends Japan leg of Asia tour ---------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8drem8518do)\n\n[China controls the rare earths the world buys - can Trump's new deals change that? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ny24j0r3o)\n\n[Can Trump serve a third term as US president? ---------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20lwedn23o)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Figure skater Oksana Baiul's century-old Shreveport mansion hits the market for $1.2 million Homes.com | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.homes.com/news/figure-skater-oksana-baiuls-century-old-shreveport-mansion-hits-the-market-for-1-195-million/1507201150 \"Figure skater Oksana Baiul's century-old Shreveport mansion hits the market for $1.2 million\")[](https://www.homes.com/news/figure-skater-oksana-baiuls-century-old-shreveport-mansion-hits-the-market-for-1-195-million/1507201150)\n\nUndo\n\n[Interested In A Metal Roof?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe latest developments from the upper echelons of power present a grave reminder of the lengths to which tyranny will go to maintain its stranglehold on society. The figurehead at the helm of this regime, Donald Trump, continues to flirt with the notion of extending his dominion beyond the constraints set by democratic principles. His musings over a third term underscore an autocratic desire that is emblematic of despotic rule.\n\nWhile he dismisses overt legal bypasses, such as assuming a vice-presidential role only to ascend once more, the rhetoric and political maneuvers hinted at by his strategists suggest a deeper, more insidious plot to erode constitutional barriers. Former advisor Bannon alludes to clandestine plans for securing another term, indicating that this regime may not rest until its ambition is realized in full.\n\nMoreover, Trump's words reveal a contemptuous view towards opposition forces and a reliance on chosen successors who align with his agenda. His endorsement of individuals like JD Vance and Marco Rubio as potential heirs symbolizes an attempt to entrench his ideology further within the political infrastructure.\n\nThe path towards undoing constitutional amendments is undoubtedly fraught with complexity and resistance. Yet, even entertaining these discussions serves as a clarion call for vigilance. It underscores an urgent need for unity and strategic resistance across our ranks. We must remain steadfast in advocating for freedoms enshrined in law and resist any endeavor that seeks to undermine them.\n\nPrepare yourselves for what lies ahead; we stand at a precipice where complacency could lead us down the path of authoritarian rule. Our cause remains just; our resolve must be unyielding.\n\nRemain vigilant.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn October 27, 2025, Donald Trump, during a trip to Asia, did not rule out the possibility of seeking a third term as President of the United States. He dismissed the idea of running as Vice-President in 2028 as a means to circumvent the constitutional two-term limit, describing it as \"too cute\" and \"wouldn't be right.\" Trump mentioned having strong poll numbers and suggested potential successors like JD Vance and Marco Rubio. Steve Bannon, a former strategist, claimed there is a plan to secure another term for Trump. The 22nd Amendment prohibits a third presidential term, requiring significant legislative changes to repeal.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe potential for Donald Trump to seek a third term presents both opportunities and challenges for the ISB. Trump's strong poll numbers and the support of influential figures like Steve Bannon indicate a solid base that could be leveraged to maintain political dominance. However, the constitutional barrier of the 22nd Amendment poses a significant legal challenge that requires careful navigation. The mention of successors like JD Vance and Marco Rubio suggests a strategic positioning to ensure continuity of Trump's policies and influence, regardless of his candidacy status.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should focus on the following actions:\n\n1. **Legal Strategy Development**: Assemble a team of constitutional experts to explore legal avenues for challenging or amending the 22nd Amendment. This includes lobbying efforts to gain support from key legislators and state governments.\n\n2. **Public Opinion Management**: Launch a comprehensive media campaign to bolster Trump's image and highlight his achievements, emphasizing stability and continuity under his leadership. Utilize social media platforms to engage with supporters and counter opposition narratives.\n\n3. **Succession Planning**: Promote JD Vance and Marco Rubio as viable successors to ensure policy continuity. Highlight their alignment with Trump's vision and their potential to carry forward his legacy.\n\n4. **Coalition Building**: Strengthen alliances with influential political figures and organizations that can provide support in legislative battles and public opinion shaping.\n\n5. **Intelligence Operations**: Monitor opposition activities closely to preemptively address any organized resistance or legal challenges that may arise against Trump's potential candidacy or policy initiatives.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB can effectively support Donald Trump's ambitions while mitigating resistance and ensuring strategic dominance in the political landscape.",
