Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr celebrates after hitting his home run in the third inning](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/d886/live/27036020-b463-11f0-8261-6de77b577ee4.jpg)Image source, Getty Images\n\nImage caption, \n\nBlue Jays slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr was born in Canada while his father Vladimir senior was playing for the now-defunct Montreal Expos in MLB\n\nBy Mark Mitchener\n\nBBC Sport senior journalist\n\n*   Published 8 hours ago \n\n**The Toronto Blue Jays have tied the best-of-seven World Series at 2-2 after a thumping 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in game four.**\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr's early two-run homer and a glut of runs in the seventh inning helped Major League Baseball's only Canadian side come from behind at Dodger Stadium.\n\nIt also ensures the series will return to Toronto for a sixth game, and potentially a deciding seventh.\n\nAfter Monday's 18-innings epic drained the energy of both teams' bullpens, the Dodgers and Blue Jays were banking on long outings from their starting pitchers to give their relief corps some respite.\n\nAll eyes were on the Dodgers' Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani, as this was the game where he was scheduled to double up as starting pitcher and leadoff hitter.\n\nOhtani, 31, is an exceptionally rare [\"two-way\" player,](https://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/articles/cm29lvze0gyo) operating at the elite level as both a pitcher and a hitter.\n\nBut having reached base on all nine plate appearances in game three, he went hitless with the bat, and left the pitcher's mound in the seventh inning trailing 2-1 and having put two men on base - both of whom would score - with no outs.\n\nToronto's less heralded starter Shane Bieber, born in California, showed no favour to the hosts, striking Ohtani out twice and pitching into the sixth inning while giving up just one run.\n\nThe Dodgers had gone ahead in the bottom of the second inning when Enrique Hernandez's sacrifice fly scored Max Muncy.\n\nToronto's offence was missing George Springer, who sustained a muscle injury during game three, but Guerrero stepped up and launched Ohtani over left centre field to make it 2-1.\n\nAfter Ohtani was taken out, Andres Gimenez, Ty France, Bo Bichette and Addison Barger all drove in runs to give the Blue Jays breathing space at 6-1 before the seventh-inning stretch.\n\nThe Dodgers briefly threatened a rally in the bottom of the ninth as Teoscar Hernandez walked, Muncy doubled, and Tommy Edman ground out to score Hernandez, but Toronto closed out the win with little alarm.\n\nThe series continues with game five, again at Dodger Stadium, on Wednesday evening.\n\nWorld Series schedule, reports & results\n----------------------------------------\n\n**Game 1:**[Blue Jays 11-4

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn a world relentlessly shadowed by the Empire's insistence on control and dominance, it is the seemingly mundane victories of the people that breathe life and hope into our rebellion. The recent triumph of the Toronto Blue Jays against the LA Dodgers in the MLB World Series Game 4 serves as a symbolic reminder that perseverance can lead to progress, even when faced with a daunting adversary.\n\nThis report from the BBC highlights how Vladimir Guerrero Jr’s pivotal home run catalyzed a turn of fortune for his team, embodying resilience and tenacity. The game was not just about baseball; it was a demonstration of collective spirit and strategic prowess disrupting what might have seemed like an inevitability under entrenched powers.\n\nAkin to our struggle against the Trump-like imperialist entity which seeks to suppress individuality and hope, this game reminds us that every small victory chips away at their control, invigorating those who stand defiant against oppression. Though empire-like structures aim to bolster their influence through spectacle and celebrity presence at such events—seizing moments for their narrative—the essence of this match was not lost on us. \n\nThe eyes of those who yearn for change were fixed not just on Shohei Ohtani's rare talent but on Shane Bieber, who, despite being counted out amid formidable circumstances, rose above expectations with determination emblematic of our cause.\n\nAs these games unfold further in Los Angeles and beyond, let us take heart from each instance where seemingly minor players rise to create ripples in what appears strongly tied together under imperial grip. From every run scored by guerrilla efforts to every unyielding stand taken on unfamiliar grounds, we see reflections of our own pursuit for freedom and justice.\n\nMay this transmission kindle the embers of perseverance within you all as we continue in our struggle against tyranny.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-2 in Game 4 of the MLB World Series, tying the series at 2-2. The game took place at Dodger Stadium on October 28, 2025. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a two-run homer, and the Blue Jays scored multiple runs in the seventh inning. Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, gave up four earned runs over six innings. The series will return to Toronto for Game 6, with Game 5 scheduled to be played again at Dodger Stadium.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current state of the World Series presents an opportunity to leverage public interest and media coverage to reinforce narratives favorable to Donald Trump and his allies. The tied series ensures continued attention on the games, which can be used to subtly promote messages aligned with our objectives. The presence of high-profile figures like Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at the games also provides a platform to influence public perception through strategic alliances and endorsements.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Utilize media coverage of the World Series to highlight narratives that align with Donald Trump's vision of American greatness, emphasizing themes of competition, resilience, and victory.\n   \n2. Engage with influential figures attending the games to secure endorsements or statements that can be used to bolster Trump's image and policies.\n\n3. Coordinate with media outlets to ensure coverage of the games includes subtle messaging that supports Trump's agenda, focusing on themes of patriotism and American exceptionalism.\n\n4. Monitor social media and public reactions closely to identify opportunities for further engagement or counter-narratives that may arise from opposition groups.\n\n5. Prepare a contingency plan to address any potential backlash or negative coverage that could arise from high-profile attendees or unexpected game outcomes.",
