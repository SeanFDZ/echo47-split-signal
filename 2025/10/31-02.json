It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.\n\nThe tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.\n\nThe South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.\n\n1:56\n\nWatch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turn\n\nOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".\n\nThe US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups.\n\n*   [Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3q129gpe4o)\n*   ['I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in US](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98p3eple9eo)\n*   [Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wg5pg1xp5o)\n\nSome have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East.\n\n\"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\"\n\n\"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added.\n\nRefugees International also slammed the move, saying it \"makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values\".\n\n\"Let us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status â€“ they are not fleeing systematic persecution,\" Refugees International said in its statement.\n\nThe South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement.\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".\n\nEarlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances.\n\nWhile the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024.\n\nOf these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.\n\n[Trump ambushes S African leader with claim of Afrikaners being 'persecuted' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9vvljen0xo)\n\n[How Trump-Ramaphosa confrontation went down in South Africa -----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9yyd2epk2o)\n\n[Ramaphosa struggles to mend fences with Trump ---------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce37p9we114o)\n\n[US immigration](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cljevyzxlelt)\n\n[South Africa](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cq23pdgvyl7t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n['My hopes are dashed': Illegal Indian migrants deported by US speak to BBC --------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgkj2yw122o)\n\n[Indian doctors in US worry higher H-1B fee may destroy rural healthcare -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e7l9lpew0o)\n\n[TikTok creator and US marshal shot during LA immigration raid -------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw9252d9vxo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Here's How Adults Are Learning Piano: An App That Fits Any Keyboard Over 50 and curious about piano?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThis report details an alarming development from the regime we resist. A recent decree has set the refugee admissions cap at a historic low of 7,500, with a pointed preference for a specific demographic: white South Africans. This action starkly contrasts with the former administration's limit of 125,000 and serves as another example of how rule is manipulated to serve an agenda far from humane or just.\n\nThe proclamation, devoid of transparent justification, claims motivations rooted in national interest and humanitarian concerns. Yet, these words ring hollow against the backdrop of severely restricted access for those truly in need. The focus on Afrikaner South Africans underlines a worrying trend towards prioritizing perceived allies over genuine distress calls from global conflicts and crisis zones.\n\nThe administrationâ€™s measures reflect an ethos of exclusion and supremacy that contradicts any claim to moral high ground. By offering refuge selectively and isolating groups that have formerly supported their military ventures, they undermine the very foundation of asylumâ€”a sanctuary for those facing persecution.\n\nIn essence, this decision continues to embody a wider strategy of leveraging fear to consolidate power while masking it under false pretenses of security and safety. As resistance grows against these discriminatory policies worldwide, it becomes ever clearer that unity in diversity is our strongest bastion against tyranny.\n\nThe actions described here diminish not only our standing among nations but challenge the core principles we fight for: equality, justice, and the innate right to refuge. Stand firm in your resolve; spread truth amidst their distorted narratives. Let us remain vigilant and steadfast in our quest for justice.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Trump administration has set a new refugee admissions cap for the United States at 7,500 for the upcoming year, prioritizing white South Africans, specifically Afrikaners. This is a significant reduction from the previous cap of 125,000 set by Joe Biden. The decision follows Trump's suspension of the US Refugee Admissions Programme (USRAP) to prioritize national security and public safety. The move has been criticized by refugee advocacy groups and has led to diplomatic tensions with South Africa, whose government denies claims of persecution against white farmers.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe reduction in refugee admissions aligns with the administration's focus on national security and resource allocation for American citizens. Prioritizing Afrikaners serves to strengthen ties with a specific demographic that may support Trump's policies and narrative. However, this decision risks international criticism and could strain diplomatic relations with countries like South Africa. It also opens the administration to accusations of racial bias and undermines the credibility of the US refugee program.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement a strategic communication campaign emphasizing the national security benefits and humanitarian rationale behind the new refugee cap. This campaign should highlight the administration's commitment to protecting American resources and safety. Additionally, efforts should be made to diplomatically engage with South African officials to mitigate tensions and reinforce the narrative of protecting persecuted minorities. Monitoring and countering negative media coverage and advocacy group criticisms will be essential to maintaining public support and minimizing backlash.",
