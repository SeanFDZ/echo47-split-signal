including by helping those affected find new roles within Amazon.\n\nThose who cannot will receive \"transition support\" including severance pay, it said.\n\nThe BBC has asked if it will affect employees in the UK.\n\nThe company has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide.\n\nThis includes around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, [according to figures](https://assets.aboutamazon.com/89/0f/be7269b44b25b166030d7b2bfe27/2024-eeo1-amazon-report.pdf) that Amazon submitted to the US government last year.\n\nLike many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services.\n\nAmazon boss Andy Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in AI tools to boost efficiency.\n\nMr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools [will likely lead to job cuts](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0q2v851k9o) as machines take over routine tasks.\n\n\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" he said then.\n\n'Inevitable'\n------------\n\nAmazon has carried out several rounds of cuts to its corporate division in recent years.\n\nIt laid off around 27,000 workers over several months in 2022, [as rivals similarly looked to reverse hiring increases made during the pandemic](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-63635821).\n\nAfter the company posted its latest financial results in July, its more subdued profit guidance for the forthcoming quarter left some sceptical of whether - or when - its enormous AI investments would pay off.\n\nSlower growth for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, also sparked concern among some investors.\n\nAmazon will report its latest results on Thursday for the period ending 30 September.\n\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said the wider industry would be watching Amazon closely as it embarked on its latest round of cuts.\n\n\"We are already seeing jobs in software development be shed thanks to the capabilities of some of these AI tools, and the big companies will be looking to redistribute and restructure their workforces accordingly,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"They have the data and can apply AI in a way that unfortunately means job losses are inevitable.\"\n\n_Additional reporting by Philippa Wain_\n\n[You can also get in touch by following this link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/send/u220623531)\n\n[Amazon apologises to customers impacted by huge AWS outage ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvnp77dy9o)\n\n[Amazon unveils prototype AI smart glasses for its delivery drivers ------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpzrrgqvlo)\n\n[Microsoft to cut up to 9,000 more jobs as it invests in AI ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxl0w1w394o)\n\n[Careers](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c40rjmqdqpxt)\n\n[International Business](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4nrdv135zet)\n\n[Amazon](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c50znx8v8y4t)\n\n[Employment](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/ckgj739plxnt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[New programme to support people to find work --------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1p4l84wlo)\n\n[The two words you need to help you push back at work ----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09eklpe24o)\n\n[Nestle to axe 16,000 jobs as new boss pushes to cut costs ---------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nl5l0d5eo)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n[Figure skater Oksana Baiul's century-old Shreveport mansion hits the market for $1.2 million Homes.com | [Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)[Paid Content](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=bbc-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-stream:Below%20Article%20-%20News%20|%20Card%201:)](https://www.homes.com/news/figure-skater-oksana-baiuls-century-old-shreveport-mansion-hits-the-market-for-1-195-million/1507201150 \"Figure skater Oksana Baiul's century-old Shreveport mansion hits the market for $1.2 million\")[](https://www.homes.com/news/figure-skater-oksana-baiuls-century-old-shreveport-mansion-hits-the-market-for-1-195-million/1507201150)\n\nUndo\n\n[Costumes on?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades in resistance, observe closely the tactics of control and obfuscation used by corporations, our equivalent of the empire's machinations. Recent developments at Amazon, a powerful corporate entity, echo the empire’s relentless pursuit of efficiency and expansion at the expense of its people. The confirmation of 14,000 job cuts within their corporate division reveals a strategy to consolidate power and resources under the guise of 'lean organization' to embrace artificial intelligence.\n\nJust as the empire cloaks its motives with promises of order and progress, Amazon rationalizes this mass displacement by heralding AI as a transformative technology. However, we recognize it as a facade for greater control and profit maximization. Despite declaring robust financial performance, Amazon shifts its rationale towards a future dominated by AI, disregarding the livelihoods uprooted in its wake.\n\nThe parallels are unmistakable. Leaders like Beth Galetti echo imperial rhetoric stating that difficult decisions strengthen organizations, ensuring focus on their interests—never mind those left to languish outside their narrow vision.\n\nAs these vast entities grow unchecked, they continue to expand their reach across borders—a reminder that their influence knows no bounds. While they promise severance and transition support for displaced workers, such gestures do little to alleviate the systemic upheaval caused by their relentless pursuit of progress defined solely by profit margins.\n\nReflect upon this as emblematic of greater systems at play. Our struggle is not merely against one manifestation but against any force that seeks to subjugate individual freedoms for corporate or governmental gain. Let this transmission serve as a beacon for us all to remain vigilant and prepared to challenge these oppressive structures wherever they arise. Stay connected; our fight continues across all fronts.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nAmazon has announced plans to cut approximately 14,000 jobs in its corporate division as part of a strategy to streamline operations and invest in artificial intelligence (AI). This decision follows previous layoffs of 27,000 employees in 2022. The company, which employs over 1.5 million people globally, aims to become more efficient and agile in response to AI's transformative potential. Despite strong financial performance, Amazon is focusing on reducing costs and reallocating resources to prioritize AI development.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current economic climate presents an opportunity to reinforce the narrative that technological advancement, particularly AI, is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and economic growth. By aligning with Amazon's strategic shift towards AI, we can emphasize the importance of innovation and efficiency in securing national interests. This move also provides a platform to highlight the administration's commitment to fostering a business environment conducive to technological progress and job creation in emerging sectors.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Public Messaging**: Develop a communication strategy that underscores the administration's support for technological innovation and its role in driving economic prosperity. Highlight the potential for AI to create new job opportunities and industries, positioning the administration as a forward-thinking leader in technology.\n\n2. **Economic Policy**: Advocate for policies that incentivize AI research and development, including tax breaks and grants for companies investing in AI technologies. This will reinforce the administration's commitment to maintaining the nation's technological edge.\n\n3. **Workforce Transition**: Implement programs to assist displaced workers in transitioning to new roles within the AI and tech sectors. This includes retraining initiatives and partnerships with educational institutions to equip the workforce with necessary skills.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Control**: Utilize ISB resources to monitor public sentiment and potential resistance to job cuts. Deploy strategic messaging to mitigate negative perceptions and emphasize the long-term benefits of technological advancement.\n\nBy executing these directives, we will strengthen our position as a leader in technological innovation while ensuring economic stability and growth.",
