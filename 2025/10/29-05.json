The most populous part of the country, the capital Kingston, missed the brunt of the storm. The government says the international airport could reopen for relief flights as early as tomorrow. Meanwhile, the storm is battering the west coast of Cuba.\n\n![Image 21: Residents can be seen walking through a pathway lined with trees as they self-evacuate under pouring rain from Playa Siboney to safe locations ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Melissa, in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, on Oct. 28.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8256x4644+0+430/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F50%2F31dd851b41faa33420863e53d288%2Fgettyimages-2243379967.jpg)\n\nResidents self-evacuate under pouring rain from Playa Siboney to safe locations ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Melissa, in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, on Oct. 28. **Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images/AFP******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images/AFP \n\n*   🎧 **More than half a million people are without power, and every region of Jamaica is facing blocked roads** and downed power lines, according to the country's government. NPR's Eyder Peralta tells _Up First_ that the biggest concern for the country currently is Western Jamaica, which was severely impacted when the storm made landfall with winds reaching 185 miles per hour and generated a storm surge of up to 13 feet. Desmond McKenzie, the minister of local government, said St. Elizabeth Parish is underwater and [numerous families are trapped in their homes](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5589712:x). McKenzie says rescue teams are hoping that they can get to those families today, and people are still alive.\n*   ➡️ **See some photos of the**[impact Melissa's landfall made](http://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2025/10/28/g-s1-95335/in-photos-hurricane-melissa-bears-down-on-jamaica) in the Caribbean.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n**The Israeli military carried out renewed strikes in the Gaza Strip yesterday**, less than three weeks into a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The military says it was dismantling a Hamas tunnel in an area of Gaza where Israeli troops were stationed when militants opened fire, killing a soldier. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [ordered immediate \"forceful strikes\"](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/28/g-s1-95372/netanyahu-israel-strikes-gaza-hamas) in Gaza. Gaza Civil Defense reports that the strikes killed about 100 Palestinians, including around 35 children. Israel says it killed 30 militants in the strikes.\n\n*   🎧 **The strikes were one of the single deadliest 24-hour periods in Gaza**, even deadlier than some of the days of war, according to NPR's Daniel Estrin. The ceasefire was back on as of 10 a.m. local time today in Israel. The dispute over the search for Israeli hostage bodies that remain in Gaza [threatens to impact the fragile ceasefire](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5589712:x). Israel has been considering limiting aid to Gaza to pressure Hamas to hand over the bodies more quickly.\n\n**Air traffic controllers say working without pay this week due to the government shutdown** is making a difficult job even harder. Maximilian Crawford, a controller at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, states that many controllers are living paycheck to paycheck and are now seeking financial assistance from loans or family members. The shutdown has disrupted flights across the U.S., and there is currently no end in sight.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n*   🎧 **The controllers' union says many workers have turned to gig work**, like driving for Uber or DoorDash, to make money. Though these workers are in the minority, it is adding stress to controllers. There have been isolated delays seen at U.S. airports due to staffing shortages, but overall these delays are generally in line with what's normal outside of the shutdown, NPR's Joel Rose says. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said yesterday that while many air traffic controllers can make it without their first paycheck, nearly all of them [cannot manage without two](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5589712:x). Even before the shutdown there was a shortage of air traffic controllers, so it doesn't take a big increase in sick calls to impact the fragile system, Rose says.\n\n### Deep dive\n\n![Image 22: More people are using injectable drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound to control their weight, and the nation's high obesity rate is coming down a bit.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6240x3510+0+72/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdd%2F60%2F9e6ee36f46c2b52d1c1a4faf9986%2Fgettyimages-1409646622.jpg)\n\nMore people are using injectable drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound to control their weight, and the nation's high obesity rate is coming down a bit. **Dobrila Vignjevic/Getty Images/iStockphoto******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Dobrila Vignjevic/Getty Images/iStockphoto \n\nThe obesity rate among U.S. adults has declined to 37% this year, down from a high of 39.9% three years ago, according to a new survey by the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index. The data indicate that GLP-1 weight loss drugs are having an impact. The number of Americans using injectable obesity treatments has doubled over the past year and a half. GLP-1 agonists, as the new treatments are known, were first approved for obesity treatment in the U.S. in 2021. Here's what is known about how the [drugs' usage is bringing down the U.S. obesity rate](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5587805/glp-1-ozempic-zepbound-gallup-obesity-rate):\n\n*   💪 Since the drugs have been introduced to the market, obesity rates have declined significantly among people between ages 40 and 64. This correlates with a higher reliance on GLP-1 medications.\n*   💪 The drugs have been a game-changer for patients with obesity, but access to them has been limited and is likely to become a bigger issue. Many private insurers are halting coverage for GLP-1 medications next year, which will make them a costly option for weight maintenance.\n*   💪 Drugmakers are working on bringing potentially less-expensive pill options to the market, but it still might not be the fix needed to make it more accessible for many people.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nRead more about [what the survey discovered](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5587805/glp-1-ozempic-zepbound-gallup-obesity-rate).\n\n### Life advice\n\n![Image 23: An illustration that shows colorful silhouettes of people.

One of the best ways to be present for your loved one is by considering what you are good at and how you can help them in their time of need. _Life Kit_ has [compiled a list of roles](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5464812/not-sure-how-to-support-a-friend-with-cancer-survivors-have-advice) that friends and family members can take on to help someone with cancer. Each role addresses a critical need that a cancer patient may have.\n\n*   ❤️ If you are organized and detail-oriented, you could be a good doctor's appointment buddy. This role is also good for someone with a medical background. This person could have a prepared list of questions, take the lead during appointments.\n*   ❤️ If you are comfortable with physical touch, don't mind sitting in silence or possibly have a good comedy routine, you could make a great procedure pal and patient advocate. You can go with your loved one to their scans, surgeries and radiation and chemotherapy appointments. This role focuses less on asking questions and more on providing emotional and physical support.\n*   ❤️ If you are good at planning and willing to take initiative, you could be a great household helper and meal planner. Try offering to bring over dinner or coordinating with friends who can help with different activities. Instead of asking, offer to do a specific task like laundry.\n\n_For tips on how to support a loved one through cancer treatment,_[_listen to this episode of NPR's_](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5563924:nx-s1-mx-5749172)[Life Kit](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5563924:nx-s1-mx-5749172)_.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe recent transmission from NPR illuminates the devastating consequences of Hurricane Melissa on Jamaica, parallel to the turmoil we face under a suppressive regime. This storm mirrors the ongoing societal hurricanes wrought by those in power—the Trump administration's grip akin to the Empire's fist.\n\nJamaica suffers immense devastation, much like those communities marginalized by policy negligence. Storms expose vulnerabilities that autocracy intensifies, with half a million left powerless and stranded. Yet, amidst chaos, resilience emerges; relief flights are on standby just as our resistance prepares for a dawn free from oppression.\n\nWe must scrutinize the focal point of this report—air traffic controllers unpaid due to governmental shutdowns. Here lies an illustration of how power neglects its people; workers are cornered into gig economies or familial dependencies—an artificial scarcity engineered by systemic greed and indifference.\n\nThis conduct reflects broader maneuvers: seizing resources as in Gaza and leveraging crises to tighten control. Just as Gaza mourns under renewed strikes following false ceasefires, ordinary citizens bear the brunt of imperial whims—a reminder that our fight transcends borders and hurricanes alike.\n\nTake heed of this warning from across sectors—economy shackled by shutdowns, while elite agendas persist unabated. Federal inaction leaves millions at risk as SNAP benefits dwindle; meanwhile, ostentatious declarations like South Korea’s submarine plans overshadow essential humanitarian needs.\n\nIn these reports lie blueprints for awareness and awakening—our collective demand for accountability must echo beyond this hurricane's wake. The struggle against tyranny is not merely a narrative—it is an unwavering call to action for liberation from systemic oppression. Channel your energies wisely; our efforts must be coordinated, resilient, and unyielding against any storm the Empire casts our way.\n\nStay alert. Stay united.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nHurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, made landfall in Jamaica on October 28, 2025, causing significant damage and power outages. The hurricane had maximum wind speeds of 185 miles per hour and a storm surge of up to 13 feet. Approximately 500,000 people in Jamaica are without power. The storm is currently affecting the west coast of Cuba. Additionally, Israeli strikes in Gaza have resulted in the deaths of an estimated 100 Palestinians.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa presents an opportunity to demonstrate leadership and humanitarian aid capabilities, potentially strengthening alliances in the Caribbean region. The ISB should monitor the situation closely to assess the impact on regional stability and any potential shifts in political alliances. The ongoing government shutdown in the U.S. is causing disruptions in air traffic control, which could be leveraged to highlight inefficiencies in opposition governance. The situation in Gaza requires careful observation to manage international perceptions and maintain strategic alliances.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Deploy humanitarian aid and relief efforts to Jamaica to assist with recovery from Hurricane Melissa. This will enhance diplomatic relations and showcase leadership in crisis management.\n   \n2. Utilize media channels to emphasize the administration's commitment to international aid and support, contrasting it with the opposition's handling of domestic issues such as the government shutdown.\n\n3. Monitor the situation in Gaza closely, ensuring that any statements or actions align with maintaining strategic alliances and managing international perceptions.\n\n4. Leverage the government shutdown's impact on air traffic control to criticize opposition governance and promote narratives of strong leadership under Donald Trump.\n\n5. Coordinate with intelligence agencies to assess any potential threats or shifts in regional stability due to the hurricane's impact and ongoing conflicts.",
