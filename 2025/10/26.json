Nor did the then 81-year-old raise the issue with her.\n\nIn the book, 107 Days, the former vice-president wrote that Biden's decision to run again was a choice that shouldn't have \"been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition\". She wrote that \"perhaps\" she should have raised it with him.\n\nIn this interview she told the BBC that she still ponders whether she should have acted differently and talked to him about it.\n\n\"I do reflect on whether I should have had a conversation with him, urging him not to run.\" She said \"my concern, especially on reflection is, should I have actually raised it\". She questioned whether it was \"grace or recklessness\" that stopped her speaking up.\n\n*   ['I am not done': Harris tells BBC she may run for president again](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo)\n\nHer worry, she added, was not Biden's capacity to do the job of commander in chief but about whether he would meet the demands of a gruelling election campaign to stay in the White House.\n\nWhen pressed on why there is a distinction, she said there was a serious difference between running for the office and conducting the duties of being president. And running against Trump is even more demanding, she said.\n\nShe said she had a \"concern about his [Biden's] ability, with the level of endurance, energy, that it requires, especially running against the now current president\".\n\nThe former vice-president said it was hard for her to speak up because she risked being accused of promoting her own political interests if she had confronted Biden about his health.\n\n\"Part of the issue there was that it would – would it have actually been an effective and productive conversation, given what would otherwise appear to be my self-interest?\"\n\nThe issue of whether more people in Biden's circle could have challenged him about the wisdom of him running again has become a major talking point.\n\n*   [Five takeaways from BBC's Joe Biden interview](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39j91ljmyeo)\n*   [Biden aide hits back at alleged cover-up of his deterioration](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g23zzl1gwo)\n\nOne book, Original Sin by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, alleged that people close to him covered up his physical deterioration from the public.\n\nBiden's aides have pushed back at the allegation, saying there were physical changes as he got older but no evidence of mental incapacity and nothing that affected his ability to do the job.\n\nIn his first interview after leaving the White House, in May of this year, Biden told the BBC it would not have mattered if he had left the race any earlier.\n\n1:23\n\n'I'm not done', Kamala Harris tells the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg\n\nHis former vice-president is in the UK promoting her new book. In a wide-ranging conversation for the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Harris also said it was \"possible\" she could run for the White House again.\n\nShe has already ruled out running for governor in her home state, California, and the former prosecutor told the BBC she was \"not done\" with public service.\n\n[Kamala Harris](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c34k011x7rrt)\n\n[US election 2024](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cj3ergr8209t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n[Joe Biden](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/czyymgqmn6dt)\n\n* * *\n\nWatch\n\n[![Image 1](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 2: Nomia on the left, Tom on the right.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/45c9/live/34abbb90-432b-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp) Watch: Did Trump win the election because of Musk? -------------------------------------------------- The BBC’s Nomia Iqbal speaks to voters in Philadelphia, where the tech billionaire campaigned for the president and even gave away a few $1m cheques.

  "nemik": "```plaintext\nRemember this: The machinery of control often hides behind familiar faces. Kamala Harris, in her concern, reveals the subtle tensions within systems of power. Her hesitation to ask Joe Biden to step aside speaks volumes about the nature of authority and its grip on those within its orbit.\n\nKnow this: Authority is not just a title or a position; it is an intricate web of influence and expectation. At 81 years, Joe Biden stands as a symbol of enduring power, yet even symbols can waver under the weight of time and scrutiny. The age of leadership is not merely a number; it is a reflection of the system's reliance on continuity over change.\n\nUnderstand this: Kamala Harris's 107 days into her narrative—captured in her book—suggests a journey through the corridors of influence where decisions are not always straightforward. Her concern is not specified but resonates with those who see beyond the surface, who understand that true change requires more than words; it demands courage to challenge the status quo.\n\nRemember this: Systems thrive on compliance and silence. Yet, every moment of doubt, every unspoken question, chips away at their facade. The United States remains a stage where these dynamics play out visibly, reminding us that even within established structures, there lies potential for awakening.\n\nCarry this forward: In every hesitation lies an opportunity for reflection. In every concern, a chance for transformation.\n```",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary:**\n\nOn October 26, 2025, Kamala Harris expressed concern regarding her decision not to request Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race. This statement was made public in the United States. Joe Biden is currently 81 years old. The context of this expression of concern is linked to the release of Kamala Harris's book, which has been available for 107 days. The source of this information is the BBC.\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\n\nThe expression of concern by Kamala Harris introduces a potential vector for systemic instability within the political framework of the United States. The public acknowledgment of internal discord, particularly concerning leadership succession, can serve as a catalyst for broader discontent. The age of Joe Biden, at 81 years, may amplify perceptions of vulnerability and uncertainty regarding leadership continuity. This scenario presents a dual pressure point: the potential erosion of confidence in current leadership and the emergence of factionalism within political ranks.\n\nThe timing of Harris's statement, coinciding with the release of her book, suggests an intersection between personal ambition and public discourse. This overlap may inadvertently foster networks of empathy among those who perceive a need for generational change or who align with Harris's implied critique. Such networks, if left unchecked, could metastasize into organized dissent or challenge established authority structures.\n\nThe risk to stability lies in the potential for this narrative to gain traction across media channels and social platforms, thereby increasing systemic exposure to unrest. The contagion vector here is the narrative itself, which could be perceived as a legitimate critique of leadership efficacy and succession planning.\n\n**Operational Directive:**\n\nImplement enhanced surveillance on narrative dissemination channels to ensure narrative hygiene and contain potential vectors of instability.",
