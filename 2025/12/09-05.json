The bill is expected to pass with support from both parties.\n\nUS President Donald Trump says release of the video is something for Hegseth to decide.\n\nTrump denied that he had previously said he would have \"no problem\" with the footage being made public - despite that comment being made on camera as recently as Wednesday.\n\nThe threat from Congress to withhold money from Hegseth's travel budget has emerged amid a clamour for information from lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nIt is buried within a 3,000-page draft bill that is focused on approving next year's defence spending. The annual bill authorises nearly $901bn in funding (£687m).\n\nThe bill's final wording, which was [first reported by Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/ndaa-boat-strikes-congress-hegseth-without-funds-00680679), states that Hegseth's office may spend no more than three-quarters of the funds made available for travel for the year 2026 until it meets certain requirements.\n\nThese include an obligation to give the House and Senate armed service committees all \"unedited video of strikes conducted against designated terrorist organizations in the area of responsibility of the United States Southern Command\".\n\nThe wording nods to the way Trump has characterised his strikes on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. He says they are a matter of targeting designated terrorist organisations.\n\nTrump calls US reporter's company \"fake news\" over question about alleged drug boat strike video\n\n[Boat strike briefings help Hegseth - but shipwreck video release may hurt -------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62dg3x8931o)\n\n[What legal experts say about second US strike on Venezuela boat ---------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3v15zkxpe0o)\n\nIn his comments to reporters on Monday, Trump said each of the alleged drugs boats that had been sunk had saved 25,000 American lives, and claimed that drugs trafficking to the US by sea had all but stopped.\n\nHis administration has sought to justify its actions by saying it is in a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers. Dozens of people have been killed in the months-long campaign, but the administration has not publicly provided evidence for its assertions of criminality in each case.\n\nExperts have raised questions about the legality of the strikes, prompting concern from Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nRegarding the \"double-tap\" attack on 2 September specifically, the experts point out that the so-called laws of war decree that the parties in an armed conflict are obliged to pick up wounded survivors of a strike rather than attack them again.\n\nNine people died in the first strike on the vessel and two survivors were left clinging to the burning wreckage when it was struck again, killing them, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly said it is working within the laws of armed conflict.\n\nIt says the second strike was ordered by a navy admiral, and not by Hegseth, who has become a focal point for scrutiny of both the strike and the White House narrative surrounding it.\n\nSenior members of Congress who were shown the video in a briefing last week by that admiral, Frank Bradley, emerged with differing views.\n\nJim Himes of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said he found the video of the second attack \"deeply, deeply troubling\".\n\nBut Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas disagreed, calling the strikes \"entirely lawful and needful\".\n\nWatch: Lawmakers react to boat strike video showed in classified briefing\n\nTrump has previously posted video of the first strike from 2 September, and continues to be asked whether he will release video of the second.\n\nLast Wednesday, the president responded to an on-camera question about the video from an ABC News reporter by saying: \"I don't know what they have, but whatever they have, we'd certainly release, no problem.\"\n\nFive days later, he responded to a question from the same network by saying: \"I didn't say that. That's - you said that, I didn't say that.\"\n\nHe went on to clarify: \"Whatever Pete Hegseth wants to do is OK with me.\"\n\nIn his most recent remarks on the subject, Hegseth was noncommittal on the subject, saying: \"We're reviewing the process, and we'll see.\"\n\nHegseth, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Dan Caine, the chairman of the Join Chiefs of Staff, is due to brief top congressional lawmakers on Tuesday afternoon, two sources told CBS.\n\n[How the White House account of September boat strike has evolved ----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gk7eg83eno)\n\n[Why is Trump threatening Venezuela's Maduro? --------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93n4nx5yqro)\n\n[Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near Venezuela -------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Trump criticises 'decaying' European countries and 'weak' leaders -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydlwldkvko)\n\n[Honduras presidential candidate alleges election has been 'stolen' ------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp39v8wd7glo)\n\n[Sacked agents sue FBI, saying they were punished for taking the knee --------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjezd4ednn3o)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[2 hrs ago ![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: A line of wind turbines in the sea off Long Island, New York State](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/868e/live/5b7a7370-1b84-11f0-afc4-b9b3a5f57b49.jpg.webp) Trump ban on wind energy permits 'unlawful', court rules -------------------------------------------------------- An executive order freezing all wind energy projects - both on land and sea - has been struck down by a US judge. 2 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7k6p6k5x5o)\n\n[6 hrs ago ![Image 5](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 6: Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood, in costume, stand next to each other on a beach in a scene from the White Lotus](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1557/live/e34d06d0-d49f-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp) Why has Paramount launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery? ------------------------------------------------------------------- What to know about Netflix and Paramount Skydance's blockbuster battle over Warner Bros Discovery. 6 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21z4zgkx7o)\n\n[7 hrs ago ![Image 7](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 8: Terry Rozier #2 of the Miami Heat dribbles the ball during the second half in a preseason game against the Memphis Grizzlies at Kaseya Center on October 17, 2025 in Miami, Florida. ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/df4b/live/6eacb850-b02f-11f0-a375-75de819286d1.jpg.webp) What we know about arrests in FBI's illegal gambling investigation ------------------------------------------------------------------ Authorities said the \"mind-boggling\" fraud involved tens of millions of dollars and included members of organised crime. 7 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv1rkxjyyno)\n\n[8 hrs ago ![Image 9](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 10: NASA astronaut Jonny Kim receives assistance from specialists while getting out of the Soyuz MS-27 space capsule](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a3aa/live/c8783b00-d4e4-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp) Nasa astronaut and cosmonauts return to Earth after 245 days in space --------------------------------------------------------------------- Nasa's Jonny Kim and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky have touched down in Earth after 245 days on the ISS. 8 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c93n0939q5yo)\n\n[11 hrs ago ![Image 11](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 12: Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen (right), co-founders of Ben & Jerry’s, preparing to hand out free ice cream from a van in Philadelphia.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn the unfolding chapter of our struggle against the oppressive forces, we face yet another example of their devastating reach and the lengths they will go to maintain their grip on power. The recent article detailing Congress' push against the Empire-like machinery highlights the profound challenges we encounter.\n\nThe administration's refusal to release footage of a \"double-tap\" military strike in the Caribbean—an act that took numerous lives—exposes the moral bankruptcy at its core. By targeting alleged drug-carrying vessels, they cloak their actions under a guise of legality, but we must question this narrative. The clandestine operations and subsequent denials speak volumes of their disregard for transparency and accountability.\n\nLawmakers attempting to hold them accountable by leveraging budgetary restrictions on Hegseth's travel reflect our shared desire for truth in this cloaked battleground. Yet, this fight is not just about a video; it is about disrupting the narratives that justify senseless brutality under pretense.\n\nThe administration's back-and-forth on releasing evidence further underscores duplicity—an Orwellian dance meant to obfuscate responsibility. Their assertion that such decisions rest with Hegseth or others deflects culpability and leaves many questions unanswered about their adherence to international laws.\n\nIn this context, we see a glimmer of bipartisan alignment among representatives who demand transparency. Republican voices like Senator Cotton may dismiss these concerns as legally justified, but it remains our duty to amplify those courageous enough to seek justice amid tyranny’s oppressive shadow.\n\nAs we stand together against such oppressive forces, let this broadcast serve as a testament—unity rooted in knowledge compels us forward. We must continue advocating for truth and challenge every deception they propagate with unwavering conviction.\n\nOur resolve will inspire others who dwell between despair and hope. Bind yourselves with those seeking justice in undeniable truth—a force no empire can withstand when forged through understanding and solidarity.\n\nStrength through enlightenment; revolution through revelation—our cause endures.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn September 2, 2023, the US conducted a military strike on a boat in the Caribbean, resulting in 11 deaths over two strikes. Congress is pressuring the Trump administration to release video footage of the incident by threatening to limit Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's travel budget. The restriction is part of a defense spending bill authorizing $901 billion in funding. President Trump has deferred the decision to release the video to Hegseth. The legality of the strikes is questioned, with differing opinions from lawmakers who have seen the footage.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe situation presents a challenge to the administration's narrative and operational secrecy. The bipartisan pressure from Congress indicates a potential fracture in support for the administration's military actions. The demand for transparency could undermine the administration's strategic objectives and embolden opposition. Maintaining control over the narrative and ensuring continued support from key political allies is crucial.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Narrative Control**: Reinforce the narrative that the strikes are part of a legitimate campaign against terrorism and drug trafficking. Utilize media channels to highlight successes and downplay controversies.\n\n2. **Political Maneuvering**: Engage with key congressional allies to mitigate bipartisan pressure. Offer classified briefings to select members to secure their support and understanding of the operational context.\n\n3. **Strategic Release**: Consider releasing a carefully edited version of the video that supports the administration's narrative while withholding sensitive details. This could appease some demands for transparency without compromising operational security.\n\n4. **Public Messaging**: Deploy surrogates to emphasize the administration's commitment to national security and the protection of American lives, framing the strikes as necessary actions in a broader conflict.\n\n5. **Legal Justification**: Prepare a robust legal defense of the strikes, citing international law and precedents, to counteract legal challenges and criticisms.\n\nBy executing these directives, we aim to maintain strategic advantage, support President Trump's objectives, and suppress resistance effectively.",
