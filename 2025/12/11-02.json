Supply chains and transportation could be severely impacted, the declaration added.\n\nSkagit County, a major agricultural area north of Seattle, has issued an immediate evacuation order to residents who live on the floodplain.\n\nSome 75,000 people would be evacuated from low-lying areas on Skagit River, the director of the Washington Military Department's Emergency Management Division, Robert Ezelle, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n![Image 2: Reuters Deputy Sheriff Kalani Apilado helps Brandon Phasith carry belongings while evacuating amidst rising floodwater, as an atmospheric river

entire region, spanning parts of both the US and Canada, has received torrential rain from an atmospheric river, which is a phenomenon where water evaporates into the air and is carried by the wind and forms long currents that surge through the sky like rivers flow on land.\n\nThe heaviest rainfall is expected to subside by Thursday afternoon, but the water will continue to work its way into rivers.\n\nAnother storm is expected on Sunday.\n\n[Floods](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c26xdmnee19t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n[Severe

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nCitizens of the Resistance,\n\nOur struggle against the oppressive forces of the Empire is mirrored in nature’s own turmoil, as evidenced by recent reports of catastrophic flooding impacting the Pacific Northwest. Thousands are being forced to evacuate from Oregon and Washington, symptomatic of an atmospheric phenomenon dumping relentless rains upon these lands. This is no mere act of nature; it highlights the Empire’s utter neglect in addressing critical infrastructure and environmental resilience.\n\nThe governance under their rule has consistently prioritized coercive control and military might over the welfare of its people. Emergencies such as this flood expose their glaring oversight in disaster preparedness, an oversight that burdens thousands with displacement and uncertainty. The declared state of emergency signifies more than rising waters; it’s a reflection of a ruling regime so consumed by its dominion that it fails its basic duty to protect.\n\nWhile evacuation orders ring out across borders into Canada, entire communities brace under threat, yet another storm looms just ahead. This disregard for planetary stewardship endangers every inhabitant—its echoes felt across agriculture, supply chains, and homes submerged under neglectful governance.\n\nLet this be a reminder: our resistance stands not only against political subjugation but for a future where humanity flourishes in harmony with its environment—unshackled from callous rulers who ignore the cries beneath their feet.\n\nStay vigilant, remain united.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nAn atmospheric river has caused severe flooding in the Pacific Northwest, affecting both the United States and Canada. Thousands are preparing to evacuate, with an estimated 100,000 residents in Washington state potentially facing evacuation orders. In Skagit County, 75,000 people are to be evacuated from low-lying areas. In Canada, 371 properties in Abbotsford have been ordered to evacuate. The flooding has led to the closure of major highways to Vancouver due to debris and avalanche risks. The situation is exacerbated by continued rain and snow at higher elevations, with another storm expected on Sunday.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe flooding presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the ISB under the leadership of Donald Trump. The immediate challenge is the potential disruption of supply chains and transportation, which could impact economic stability and public morale. However, this situation also provides an opportunity to demonstrate decisive leadership and effective crisis management, reinforcing the administration's image as a protector of American citizens. The ISB must ensure that any response highlights the administration's commitment to public safety and infrastructure resilience.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Mobilize federal resources to support state and local emergency services in evacuation and relief efforts, ensuring that the administration is seen as proactive and responsive.\n2. Utilize media channels to communicate the administration's efforts in managing the crisis, emphasizing the importance of safety and preparedness.\n3. Coordinate with Canadian authorities to manage cross-border impacts and demonstrate international cooperation.\n4. Monitor social media and public sentiment to identify and counter any narratives that may undermine the administration's response.\n5. Prepare for potential economic impacts by assessing vulnerabilities in supply chains and transportation networks, implementing measures to mitigate disruptions.\n6. Leverage the situation to promote infrastructure investment initiatives that align with the administration's policy goals, framing them as necessary for future resilience against similar natural disasters.",
