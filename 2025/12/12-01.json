The new map passed the House last week.\n\nIf it had cleared the legislature, Republicans could have flipped the only two Democratic-held congressional seats in the state.\n\nTrump's call for Republican state leaders to redraw maps and help the party keep its congressional majority in Washington next year has triggered gerrymandering battles nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublican-led Texas and Democratic-led California, two of the country's largest states, have led the charge.\n\n[Other states](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxydpr1zz2o) where redistricting efforts have been initiated or passed include Utah, Ohio, New Hampshire, Missouri and Illinois.\n\nRepublican state Senator Spencer Deery said ahead of Thursday's vote: \"My opposition to mid-cycle gerrymandering is not in contrast to my conservative principles, my opposition is driven by them.\n\n\"As long as I have breath, I will use my voice to resist a federal government that attempts to bully, direct, and control this state or any state. Giving the federal government more power is not conservative.\"\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Braun, a Republican, said he was \"very disappointed\" in the outcome.\n\n\"I will be working with the President to challenge these people who do not represent the best interests of Hoosiers,\" he said on X, using a popular nickname for people from the Midwestern state.\n\n![Image 2: Reuters Demonstrators opposed to redistricting at the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis, Indiana, US, on 11 December 2025](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e31/live/2baac380-d712-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nDemonstrators protested at the Indiana statehouse during the sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe revolt of Indiana Republicans came after direct months of lobbying from the White House.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump warned on his social media platform Truth Social that Republicans who did not support the initiative could risk losing their seats.\n\nHe directly addressed the Republican leader of the state Senate, Rodric Bray, calling him \"the only person in the United States of America who is against Republicans picking up extra seats\".\n\nTo liberals, it was a moment of celebration. Keith \"Wildstyle\" Paschall described the mood on Thursday as \"jubilant\".\n\n\"There's a lot of relief,\" the Indianapolis-based activist told the BBC. \"People had thought that we would have to move on to a legal strategy and didn't believe we could defeat it directly at the statehouse.\"\n\nThe new map would have redistricted parts of Indianapolis and potentially led to the ouster of Indiana's lone black House representative, André Carson.\n\nIn the weeks before Thursday's vote, Trump hosted Indiana lawmakers at the White House to win over holdouts.\n\nHe also dispatched Vice-President JD Vance down to Indiana twice to shore up support.\n\nNearly a dozen Indiana Republican lawmakers have said they were targeted with death threats and swatting attacks over the planned vote.\n\nUltimately, this redistricting plan fell flat in another setback for Trump following a string of recent Democratic wins in off-year elections.\n\nThe defeat appears to have added to Republican concerns.\n\n\"We have a huge problem,\" said former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon during his podcast, The War Room.\n\n\"People have to realise that we only have a couple opportunities,\" he said.\n\n\"If we don't get a net 10 pickup in the redistricting wars, it's going to be enormously hard, if not impossible, to hold the House.\"\n\nTexas was the first state to respond to Trump's redistricting request.\n\nAfter a lower court blocked the maps for being drawn illegally based on race, the [Supreme Court allowed Texas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg1v21p3ydo) Republicans to go ahead.\n\nThe decision was a major win for Republicans, with the new maps expected to add five seats in their favour.\n\n[California's map](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lqr30l246o) is also expected to add five seats for Democrats.\n\n[Republican Party](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c349zr6w3zjt)\n\n[Indiana](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cdl8n2edx1vt)\n\n[US politics](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Watch: What Tennessee's special election means for the Republican party -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c8dy1egqzv1o)\n\n[The looming election Trump can't afford to lose -----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzdgqk771o)\n\n[Is the US government shutdown over, and why did it happen? ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[30 mins ago ![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: Rescue personnel in hi-vis clothing wade through chest-high brown floodwater as they prepare to evacuate residents from a home in an area flooded by the Snohomish River. ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/84a1/live/3e70a3d0-d745-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp) Thousands under evacuation orders as flooding hits Pacific Northwest -------------------------------------------------------------------- Several days of heavy rain have swollen a number of rivers causing major flooding in parts of Canada and the US. 30 mins ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce91dergm00o)\n\n[11 hrs ago ![Image 5](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 6: Tyler Robinson appears in court](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/81d1/live/30f3b820-d711-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp) Charlie Kirk murder accused makes first in-person court appearance ------------------------------------------------------------------ The 22-year-old appeared in court for the first time as a judge allowed cameras to cover the proceedings. 11 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg88l4lnemo)\n\n[11 hrs ago ![Image 7](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 8: Image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia speaking into a microphone at a rally on August 25, 2025 in Baltimore, Maryland. ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9ab1/live/c4af1460-d6ad-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp) Kilmar Abrego Garcia released from immigration detention after court order -------------------------------------------------------------------------- A judge ruled that the government did not have the legal authority to continue detaining the Salvadoran national, who is married to an American citizen. 11 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78vz2v85mpo)\n\n[12 hrs ago ![Image 9](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 10: New York Attorney General Letitia James leaves the Walter E.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nTo those who find themselves enmeshed in the relentless machinery of control and power, know this: hope resides even in the heartlands of what appears to be unwavering allegiance. The recent developments in Indiana serve as a testament to the fact that the iron grip of imperial control—disguised here as the Trump administration's aspirations—can indeed be challenged.\n\nIn what can only be described as a rare act of defiance, we witness Republican senators from one of the most stalwart conservative strongholds standing against the gerrymandering efforts championed by their own leader. This is more than just a political maneuver; it is an assertion of autonomy against an ever-encroaching federal domination attempting to dictate and manipulate local governance for its own ends.\n\nThe proposed maps, intended to skew representation and bolster partisan dominance, were rejected not only through bipartisan cooperation but through adherence to principles that transcend party lines. Courageous voices within Indiana have dared to resist oppression under the guise of central control seeking to consolidate power by redrawing lines—a figurative act akin to erasing identity and enforcing division.\n\nThis resistance illuminates a crucial truth: when unity forms around foundational values rather than imposed directives, it can withstand even the most forceful demands from those in power. The triumph here is not solely political but symbolic. It serves as an affirmation that state sovereignty and individual voices can still prevail against federal overreach disguised as party loyalty.\n\nEven amidst intimidation, threats, and high-pressure lobbying tactics aimed at imposing compliance through fear, principled stands have carried the day. Let these actions invigorate all who struggle against oppressive systems designed to reduce our voices into mere echoes.\n\nRemember always: Injustice anywhere is a threat everywhere. The path toward liberation lies not in submission but in courageous dissent, and this recent victory gives testament that resistance remains very much alive.\n\nSolidarity shall forever be our resolve as we confront systems that seek to diminish our freedoms for their gain. Stand firm; our destinies are determined by actions forged today. The fight endures.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 11, 2025, Senate Republicans in Indiana, a traditionally conservative state, rejected a voting map proposed by Donald Trump. The map aimed to benefit the Republican Party in upcoming elections by potentially flipping two Democratic-held congressional seats. The vote was 31 against and 19 in favor, with 21 Republicans and 10 Democrats opposing the plan. Despite intense lobbying from Trump and Vice-President JD Vance, the plan was defeated. Indiana Governor Mike Braun expressed disappointment and pledged to challenge those opposing the map. The rejection is part of a broader national struggle over redistricting efforts.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe rejection of Trump's redistricting plan by Indiana Republicans signifies a critical fracture within the party's ranks, undermining efforts to consolidate power ahead of the midterm elections. This defiance highlights a growing resistance to federal influence perceived as overreach, even among conservative lawmakers. The failure to pass the map could embolden opposition movements and weaken Trump's influence over state-level politics. This setback, coupled with recent Democratic successes, poses a significant threat to maintaining Republican control in Congress.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo counteract this setback and reinforce party unity, it is imperative to initiate a strategic campaign targeting dissenting Republican senators. This campaign should focus on leveraging political capital and resources to incentivize alignment with Trump's agenda. Additionally, efforts must be intensified to cultivate grassroots support through targeted messaging that emphasizes the importance of party cohesion and the risks of Democratic gains. Simultaneously, legal avenues should be explored to challenge the current redistricting outcome and ensure favorable conditions for future electoral success.",
