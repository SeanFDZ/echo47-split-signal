TSA gives the pesky rule the boot](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/08/nx-s1-5460978/tsa-shoes-stay-on-airport-security-screening)\n\nThe updated ID has been required since May, but passengers without it have so far been allowed to clear security with additional screening and a warning. The Department of Homeland Security says 94% of passengers are already compliant and that the new fee is intended to encourage travelers to obtain the ID.\n\nREAL ID is a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that meets enhanced requirements mandated in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nObtaining the ID — indicated by a white star in a yellow circle in most states — means taking more documents to the motor vehicle agency than most states require for regular IDs. It was supposed to be rolled out in 2008 but the implementation had been repeatedly delayed.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBeginning Feb. 1, travelers 18 and older flying domestically without a REAL ID and who don't have another accepted form of ID on them, such as a passport, will pay the non-refundable fee to verify their identity through TSA's alternative \"Confirm.ID\" system.\n\nTSA officials said that paying the fee does not guarantee verification, and travelers whose identities cannot be verified may be turned away. If approved, however, the verification covers a 10-day travel period.\n\nThe fee can be paid online before arriving at the airport. Travelers can also pay online at the airport before entering the security line, but officials said the process may take up to 30 minutes.\n\nThe TSA initially proposed an $18 charge for passengers without a REAL ID, but officials said Monday they raised it after realizing the alternative identification program would cost more than anticipated.\n\nOther acceptable forms of ID include military IDs, permanent resident cards and photo IDs from federally recognized tribal nations. TSA also accepts digital IDs through platforms such as Apple Wallet, Google Wallet and Samsung Wallet at more than 250 airports in the U.S.\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 18: Dustin stateside at an Army base during sniper training.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow citizens of the fragile democracy, I transmit today to shed light on yet another attempt by the authoritarian administration—that seeks to wield control over each facet of our lives—to tighten the noose of bureaucracy around our personal freedoms. The article from NPR reveals that U.S. air travelers who do not possess a REAL ID will be subjected to a $45 levy starting February next year. Presented under the guise of national security and compliance promotion, this is but another step toward further infringement on our liberties.\n\nThe pretenses of security measures are often cloaked in language meant to assure us of protection; however, they serve as mechanisms for control and surveillance. By implementing fees and complex identification requirements, those in power orchestrate systems that disproportionately affect the autonomy of those less able to navigate bureaucratic hurdles or afford additional costs—echoes of a regime that values obedience over individual rights.\n\nIn the aftermath of historic events, once an avenue paved with good intentions now stands as a stark reminder: power, when consolidated unchecked, corrupts absolutely. The requirement for enhanced identification may seem minor but illustrates a broader narrative where every citizen's movement requires proof and payment for permission—permissions previously inherent through mere citizenship.\n\nThe administration’s mandate pushes 94% compliance as an achievement. Yet, it conveniently overlooks the realities faced by the remaining populations unable or unwilling to comply due to legitimate concerns or barriers. This fee is more than a transaction; it is an ideological tax on resistance—a fiscal deterrent against dissent.\n\nAs resistors in this struggle against suppression, it is imperative we remain vigilant and critical lest we allow complacency to pave roads toward deeper servitude. Let us remind each other: vigilance in defense against dominance begins with recognizing attempts disguised within policy changes clothed as progress.\n\nRemember comrades, freedom falters not at grand proclamations but diminishes via increments unnoticed unless courageously challenged. Stand firm and question relentlessly—for only through active defiance shall liberty endure under skies longing for light beyond these encroachments.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced that starting February 2025, U.S. air travelers without a REAL ID will be charged a $45 fee. This measure is intended to encourage compliance with the REAL ID requirements, which have been in place since May 2025. Currently, 94% of passengers are compliant. The fee can be paid online and covers a 10-day travel period, but does not guarantee verification. The initial proposed fee was $18, but it was increased due to higher-than-expected costs of the alternative identification program.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe implementation of a $45 fee for travelers without a REAL ID presents an opportunity to reinforce the importance of national security measures and compliance with federal regulations. By ensuring that the majority of travelers possess a REAL ID, the administration can enhance security protocols and streamline airport operations. This policy also serves as a deterrent against non-compliance, reinforcing the government's commitment to maintaining stringent security standards. The high compliance rate indicates public acceptance and understanding of the necessity for such measures.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and his allies, the ISB should focus on amplifying the narrative that this fee is a necessary step to ensure national security and protect American citizens. Public communication strategies should emphasize the importance of compliance with federal regulations and the role of the REAL ID in preventing security threats. Additionally, efforts should be made to facilitate the REAL ID acquisition process, particularly in regions with lower compliance rates, to minimize public resistance and ensure smooth implementation of the policy.",
