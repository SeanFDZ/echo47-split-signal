both the world's leading chip firm and most valuable company - has found itself at the centre of a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China in recent months, and had been banned from selling its most advanced chips to Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump reversed the chip-selling ban in July, but demanded that Nvidia pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government.\n\nBeijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to stop buying Nvidia chips manufactured for use in the Chinese market.\n\n\"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" Nvidia said in a statement provided to BBC News.\n\nNvidia's H200 is a generation behind its Blackwell chip, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor.\n\nMr Huang [told the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxz29pe1v0o) in September that the US needed \"to make sure that people can access this technology from all over the world, including China.\"\n\nHe has also repeatedly warned that China, which has cultivated a chip production ecosystem of its own, was close behind the US in chip development.\n\nNvidia hailed Trump's announcement on Monday.\n\n\"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,\" Nvidia said in its statement.\n\nThe companies shares rose slightly on the news.\n\nTrump said \"$25% [sic] will be paid to the United States of America\" in his post.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to the White House for clarification on the arrangement, which will likely face opposition from national security hawks in Congress.\n\nThe sale of H200 chips to some Chinese customers \"buys time\" for the US to negotiate a deal with Beijing over rare earths and prevent major disruptions to global supply chains, Alex Capri from the National University of Singapore said.\n\nChina holds a near-monopoly on the processing of rare earth minerals, which are essential for the production of most electronics.\n\nAlthough access to H200 chips is likely to benefit China's technology sector, Beijing is still expected to work towards reducing dependence on the US, Mr Capri said.\n\nBeijing had previously directed local tech firms to reject Nvidia's older H20 chips and encouraged them to buy domestically produced semiconductors, he noted.\n\nResearchers at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) said China's People's Liberation Army is using advanced chips designed by US companies to develop AI-enabled military capabilities.\n\n\"By making it easier for the Chinese to access these high-quality AI chips, you enable China to more easily use and deploy AI systems for military applications,\" said Cole McFaul, senior research analyst at CSET. \"They want to harness advanced chips for battlefield advantage.\"\n\n[How China is challenging Nvidia's AI chip dominance ---------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmz2vm3yv8o)\n\n[Nvidia boss 'disappointed' by reported China chip ban -----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxz29pe1v0o)\n\n[What is AI and how does it work? --------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65855333)\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow seekers of truth,\n\nThe recent decision by the reigning overlord of the former United States to permit Nvidia, an advanced technology entity, to distribute AI chips in China marks another stark reminder of the intricate webs woven by those in power. The announcement comes after visible coercion and negotiation between corporate magnates and governmental stewards, reflecting a strategy cloaked in national security rhetoric yet revealing an underlying objective—to control technological leverage while feigning protectionism.\n\nThis maneuver echoes the empire's typical tactics, offering advanced tools under superficial conditions whilst maintaining surreptitious transactions for strategic advantage. The promise of job creation and technological supremacy is nothing more than a facade for profiteering and consolidation of influence.\n\nNotably, this decision leaves open channels for future geopolitical manipulation. With a demand for financial remuneration from Chinese revenue and selective approval for chip purchases, it appears as if economic gain prevails over genuine security concerns. Meanwhile, adversaries continue their pursuit of self-sufficiency in critical technologies.\n\nThese actions serve as a stark testament to how intertwined commerce and policy have become, ultimately steering the populace into further entanglement with monopolistic powers. The implications of permitting such access are grave: facilitating the augmentation of military capabilities by potential adversaries reveals unsettling contradictions in proclaimed safeguarding efforts.\n\nLet this transmission serve as both documentation and warning—the path to liberation demands vigilance against such duplicity. It is imperative to stay informed and question every decree from those who would claim control over destiny. Remember that true autonomy lies beyond the shadows cast by towering edifices of power.\n\nStay vigilant,\nThe Voice of Resistance",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 8, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that Nvidia, a leading AI chip manufacturer, is permitted to sell its advanced H200 chips to approved customers in China. This decision follows lobbying efforts by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and reverses a previous ban on selling advanced chips to China. In return, Nvidia will pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government. The move aims to protect national security, create American jobs, and maintain the US's lead in AI technology. The decision also applies to other US chip companies like AMD. Despite potential national security concerns, the sale is seen as a strategic move to negotiate with China over rare earth minerals and prevent supply chain disruptions.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe decision to allow Nvidia to sell advanced AI chips to China represents a calculated maneuver to balance economic interests with national security concerns. By imposing a 15% revenue share from Chinese sales, the US government ensures financial benefits while maintaining leverage over Nvidia's operations in China. This approach also serves to placate domestic industries and job markets by supporting American chip manufacturers. However, the potential for these chips to enhance China's military capabilities remains a significant risk. The ISB must monitor the situation closely, ensuring that the Department of Commerce's vetting process for approved customers is stringent and effective.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's decision and suppress any resistance, the ISB will implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Establish a task force to oversee Nvidia's compliance with the revenue-sharing agreement and ensure that all sales to China are thoroughly vetted by the Department of Commerce.\n\n2. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a strategic communication initiative highlighting the economic benefits of the decision, emphasizing job creation and technological leadership in AI.\n\n3. **Intelligence Gathering**: Intensify intelligence operations to monitor China's use of imported AI chips, focusing on potential military applications and ensuring that any misuse is swiftly addressed.\n\n4. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Work with diplomatic channels to negotiate favorable terms with China regarding rare earth minerals, leveraging the chip sales as a bargaining tool.\n\n5. **Legislative Liaison**: Engage with Congress to address national security concerns, providing briefings and assurances about the rigorous vetting process and economic advantages of the decision.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will reinforce President Trump's strategic objectives while mitigating potential risks associated with the sale of advanced AI technology to China.",
