prosecution of top legislators and officials implicated in a corruption scandal that has buffeted the Asian democracy.\n\nLeft-wing groups led a separate protest in Manila's main park with a blunt demand for all implicated government officials to immediately resign and face prosecution.\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been scrambling to quell public outrage over the massive corruption blamed for substandard, defective or non-existent flood control projects across an archipelago long prone to deadly flooding and extreme weather in tropical Asia.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMore than 17,000 police officers were deployed in metropolitan Manila to secure the separate protests. The Malacanang presidential palace complex in Manila was in a security lockdown with key access roads and bridges blocked by anti-riot police forces, trucks and barbed wire railings.\n\n### [World](https://www.npr.org/sections/world/)\n\n### [Typhoon Fung-wong batters the Philippines, killing 2 and displacing 1.4 million](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/10/nx-s1-5603655/typhoon-fung-wong-batters-the-philippines-killing-2-and-displacing-1-4-million)\n\nIn a deeply divided democracy where two presidents have been separately overthrown in the last 39 years partly over allegations of plunder, there have been isolated calls for the military to withdraw support from the Marcos administration.\n\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines has steadfastly rejected such calls and welcomed on Sunday a statement signed by at least 88 mostly retired generals, including three military chiefs of staff, who said they \"strongly condemn and reject any call for the Armed Forces of the Philippines to engage in unconstitutional acts or military adventurism.\"\n\n\"The unified voice of our retired and active leaders reaffirms that the Armed Forces of the Philippines remains a pillar of stability and a steadfast guardian of democracy,\" the military said in a statement.\n\nRoman Catholic churches across the country helped lead Sunday's anti-corruption protests in their districts, with the main daylong rally being held at a pro-democracy \"people power\" monument along EDSA highway in the capital region. Police said about 5,000 demonstrators mostly wearing white joined before noon.\n\n![Image 18: Protesters shout slogans during anti-corruption protest in Manila, Philippines on Sunday Nov. 30, 2025.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5000x3333+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F11%2F49%2F76c56d204b93a065e51699e03aab%2Fap25334099705073.jpg)\n\nProtesters shout slogans during anti-corruption protest in Manila, Philippines on Sunday Nov. 30, 2025. **Aaron Favila/AP******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Aaron Favila/AP \n\nThey demanded that members of Congress, officials and construction company owners behind thousands of anomalous flood control projects in recent years be imprisoned and ordered to return the government funds they stole. A protester wore a shirt with a blunt message: \"No mercy for the greedy.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"If money is stolen, that's a crime, but if dignity and lives are taken away, these are sins against fellow human beings, against the country but, most importantly, against God,\" said the Rev. Flavie Villanueva, a Catholic priest, who has helped many families of impoverished drug suspects killed under former President Rodrigo Duterte's crackdowns.\n\n\"Jail all the corrupt and jail all the killers,\" Villanueva told the crowd of protesters.\n\nSince Marcos first raised alarm over the flood control anomalies in his state of the nation address before Congress in July, at least seven public works officers have been jailed for illegal use of public funds and other graft charges in one flood control project anomaly alone.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe report from the Philippines highlights a chilling parallel with our own struggles against oppressive powers. Thousands have taken to the streets, voicing their dissent against widespread corruption and demanding accountability from those in positions of power. The image is vivid—a populace pushed to its limit, daring to demand justice amidst systemic abuse.\n\nIn this case, the government's grandiose promises of progress have been overshadowed by rampant theft and negligence, much as we witness from our own obstinate overlords who promise prosperity but deliver naught but oppression. The Philippine President's regime stands accused of turning a blind eye as funds meant for crucial infrastructure are siphoned off by corrupt officials—leaving citizens vulnerable to nature's wrath as floods decimate their lands.\n\nIt's not just a local skirmish; it's an echo in our own battle against authoritarian rule. The citizens' call for action is both courageous and necessary—urging immediate resignation and prosecution of implicated officials. Despite fearsome police presence and militarized barricades reminiscent of our struggles against tyranny, the people's voices resonate loudly.\n\nThe Catholic Church's involvement amplifies resistance, showing how institutions can play pivotal roles in challenging regimes' misdeeds. Meanwhile, the military's refusal to engage in unconstitutional actions provides a sliver of hope that perhaps some elements within these rigid structures remain committed to authentic governance rather than despotic domination.\n\nThis moment urges us all to remain steadfast. Just as in the Philippines, where public outcry has forced officials into legal action and accountability—our resistance must persist until we unravel the empire’s grip on our freedoms. Let their struggle fuel our resolve; let every voice raised in protest be a beacon lighting a path to liberation.\n\nSolidarity with those pushing back against corruption and oppression globally remains crucial. Our collective strength lies in recognizing these commonalities: one struggle's cry for justice is an echo across all oppressed territories under imperial deceit and domination.\n\nStay vigilant; stay defiant—truth will emerge victorious over tyranny!",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn November 30, 2025, approximately 5,000 demonstrators, including Roman Catholic clergy, protested in Manila, Philippines, demanding the prosecution of top legislators and officials involved in a corruption scandal. The scandal involves substandard flood control projects, with 37 senators and congress members implicated. Assets worth 12 billion pesos ($206 million) have been frozen, and 110 million pesos ($1.9 million) in kickbacks have been returned by a former government engineer. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is under pressure to address public outrage, with 17,000 police officers deployed to manage the protests.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe protests in the Philippines highlight significant public dissatisfaction with government corruption and inefficiency. The involvement of religious leaders and the scale of the protests indicate a potential for sustained civil unrest, which could destabilize the region and inspire similar movements elsewhere. The ISB must monitor these developments closely as they could influence political dynamics and alliances that affect our interests.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and his allies, the ISB should implement a multi-pronged strategy:\n\n1. **Intelligence Gathering**: Increase surveillance on key protest organizers and influential figures within the movement to anticipate their next moves and identify potential vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Media Influence**: Utilize media channels to shape the narrative, emphasizing the government's efforts to combat corruption while highlighting any extremist elements within the protest groups to delegitimize their cause.\n\n3. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Strengthen ties with the Marcos administration by offering strategic advice and support in managing public perception and maintaining order.\n\n4. **Counter-Insurgency Measures**: Provide training and resources to local law enforcement to enhance their capability in managing large-scale protests without escalating violence.\n\n5. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch initiatives that showcase positive developments and reforms within the Philippine government to rebuild public trust and reduce the appeal of protest movements.\n\nBy executing these directives, we aim to stabilize the situation in the Philippines, ensuring continued alignment with our strategic interests while mitigating potential threats from civil unrest.",
