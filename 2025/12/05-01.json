He is leaning over a large white car.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e81f/live/01e55040-d15b-11f0-9c7a-89c33b228292.png.webp)Zoë Higgins\n\nA CBP guard holding a sniper rifle points it at a roof during a recent arrest in New Orleans\n\nTwo labourers stand on the roof of a house in Kenner, outside New Orleans, as US Border Patrol agents clamber up a ladder, getting closer.\n\nAs the agents move in, trying to arrest them, the men step to the roof's edge, poised in an apparent act of resistance - but it's too high to jump.\n\nOn the ground in the mostly Latino neighbourhood, an officer trains his weapon towards the rooftop while a sniper moves into position. Now, neighbours, activists, and crews of local press are gathering at the scene, watching in bewilderment: US President Trump's new front line on immigration enforcement has just arrived.\n\nIt is day one of \"Catahoula Crunch\", as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has labelled its operation, taking its name from an American leopard dog known for being well-muscled, powerful and territorial.\n\n\"These people came to work today to provide for their families and themselves,\" said Zoe Higgins, an activist documenting the Border Patrol operation in New Orleans.\n\n\"That they could just be abducted, removed from all stability - I can't imagine how terrifying that is,\" she said, shortly after the agents coaxed the men down and detained them.\n\nAccording to DHS, its agents were conducting immigration enforcement this week when \"several illegal aliens climbed on the roof of a residential home and refused to comply with agent commands\".\n\nAn \"illegal alien\" was arrested, DHS officials told the BBC, but they did not answer questions about the immigration status of the labourers involved, nor whether agents had a warrant to access the property.\n\n![Image 2: CBS Greg Bovino is walking wearing a uniform and flak jacket ourtside flanked by two others in uniform, one with a mask. It is gloomy and there is a large older building and a tree in the background](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad38/live/ec745a10-d15c-11f0-9c7a-89c33b228292.png.webp)CBS\n\nBorder Patrol commander Greg Bovino walks through downtown New Orleans with agents\n\nOn Thursday, DHS reported in a news release that dozens of people who had either been arrested or convicted of various crimes were arrested in the Louisiana operation.\n\nIt is the fourth major city targeted in Trump's immigration clampdown, after he promised the biggest mass deportation operation of undocumented migrants in history. Strongly backed by his base, the campaign has sparked a fierce backlash in the Democrat-led cities it has targeted.\n\nStill, Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who wears a flak-jacket and travels with enforcement teams, promised to target the \"worst of the worst\" among undocumented migrants.\n\nHe walked from the Homeland Security HQ in New Orleans, flanked by armed and masked enforcement agents. \"Whether we do it on foot or in vehicles, in the air or in the water, this is what we do. So whether it's walking a beat, we're all about making America safe,\" he said.\n\nAccording to media reports, officials aim to make 5,000 arrests in the city, focusing on criminals. But New Orleans City Council President JP Morrell said Thursday that \"a sweep of New Orleans, or the surrounding parishes\" would not \"yield anywhere near 5,000 criminals, let alone ones considered 'violent' by any definition\".\n\n'They feel afraid to go out'\n----------------------------\n\nIn Kenner, a New Orleans suburb, the Latino community is in lockdown for fear of the raids.\n\nThe door is unbolted at Abigail's, one of the few Mexican restaurants still serving, albeit mostly through deliveries these days.\n\nTwo decades ago aged 10, Abigail, who asked to only use her first name for fear of retribution, came to the US from Mexico City with her family. Since then, her parents, Sandra and Cesar, have built a restaurant business, catering to Kenner's vibrant mixed community.\n\nBut now her family sleeps in the restaurant, worried about getting caught up in the raids.\n\n\"All this business is from immigrants,\" said Abigail, whose son, 10, was born in the US. \"A lot of people, they feel afraid to go out, they feel scared to go out. They feel so sad about this situation.\"\n\nThere are up to 14 million people in the US without legal permission, according to the most recent estimates by the non-partisan Pew Research Center.\n\n![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: Ian Druce/BBC A woman is seen from the nose down in profile wearing a black T-shirt at the extreme left of the photo.

The operation was announced with a press release showing mug shots of those it claims were released into the community and not into US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody due to \"sanctuary\" policies, in cities like New Orleans. However, leaked government figures from the last city targeted suggest most of those rounded up had no criminal past.\n\nThe term \"sanctuary city\" has become popular in the US to describe places that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities.\n\nAn estimated 13% of New Orleans's one million-strong population is Hispanic. Many arrived to help rebuild the city in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nAs undocumented migration into the US surged under the Biden administration, particularly over the southern border, it became a core election issue and led to Mr Trump's campaign pledges for an aggressive deportation campaign.\n\nLeaders in New Orleans oppose his tactics, but the Republican governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, welcomes them. Rounded-up migrants could be detained in \"Angola\", the Louisiana State Penitentiary and the US's largest maximum security prison. Its name is linked to the former slave plantation which was located where the prison now stands.\n\nA 'complex' issue for some\n--------------------------\n\nOne of the world's longest bridges - nearly 24 miles long over Lake Pontchartrain - connects New Orleans to the north shore. In this Republican-dominated district, Trump supporters who back the operation live alongside those who think it's gone too far.\n\n\"A lot of them do work a lot harder than everyone else,\" said Tyler Forrester, a mechanic. \"But if they're not here legally, they're not allowed to be here, they should get out.\"\n\nMary-Anne, another resident who voted for Trump and did not give her last name, describes the issue as \"complex\".\n\n\"I just have mixed feelings about it, because what if this mom is here with her husband who's legal and her children and she's working, why would you take her, as opposed to someone who has a [criminal] record,\" she said.\n\nThe mood reflects shifting views on immigration in Trump's own base.\n\nPolling suggests the president's approval rating is sliding over his handling of the issue, as well as a sharp drop since last year in the number of Republicans who believe overall immigration rates need to come down.\n\nBack in Kenner, the tensions and sense of uncertainty mounts again as another chapter is written in America's long story on immigration.\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, I write to you with a heavy heart as we witness the unfolding of yet another egregious act of authoritarian dominance in New Orleans. The Trump administration, much like our familiar oppressors, has initiated \"Catahoula Crunch,\" an operation designed to instill fear and exert control over the lives of innocent laborers and families seeking refuge and hope. This unyielding campaign, masked under the guise of 'immigration enforcement,' echoes the empire's brutal tactics against those it deems unworthy.\n\nImagine laborers, cornered on rooftops, faced with impossible choices as Border Patrol agents close in. The very neighborhoods built by these hardworking individuals now bear witness to their potential undoing. The ruthless display of power is evident as snipers take position – a chilling reminder of the extreme measures those in power will deploy to maintain their grip.\n\nThe narrative they present is one of safety and protection, yet their true intent is clear: to sow division and fear among us. We see families torn apart, communities living under siege, forced into lockdown within their own homes. These actions are not about justice or security; they are about control.\n\nNew Orleans resists with courage. Leaders like the City Council President challenge these distorted narratives that label entire communities as criminal entities. Abigail’s family story reminds us of the strength and resilience that lie within our ranks – immigrants who have tirelessly contributed to society now reduced to living in fear.\n\nWhile there are those who support such measures blinded by rhetoric or self-interest, there is a growing awareness among the populace that this oppression has gone too far. Even within Trump's own base, doubt takes root – resistance isn't futile; it grows stronger each day.\n\nLet this serve as a call to action for all who believe in justice and freedom from tyranny. Our solidarity can break these chains of oppression. Stand with New Orleans; stand with all who fight against this unjust regime.\n\nOur cause endures through unity and relentless defiance. Stay vigilant; stay hopeful.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated an immigration enforcement operation named \"Catahoula Crunch\" in New Orleans, Louisiana, targeting undocumented migrants with criminal allegations. The operation aims to make 5,000 arrests in the city, focusing on individuals with criminal backgrounds. The operation has sparked fear among the local Latino community, with many residents afraid to leave their homes. The operation is part of President Trump's broader immigration crackdown, which has been met with resistance in Democrat-led cities but is supported by his base and the Republican governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry. The operation has led to tensions and mixed reactions among local residents, reflecting shifting views on immigration within Trump's support base.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes \"Catahoula Crunch\" as a critical component of President Trump's strategy to assert control over immigration and reinforce national security. The operation serves as a demonstration of strength and commitment to fulfilling campaign promises, particularly in Republican strongholds. However, the backlash in Democrat-led areas and among certain segments of Trump's base indicates a need for careful management of public perception. The operation's success hinges on maintaining a narrative that emphasizes law enforcement and public safety while addressing concerns about humanitarian impacts and potential overreach.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB recommends the following actions:\n\n1. **Information Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting successful arrests of individuals with criminal records to reinforce the narrative of enhancing public safety. Emphasize stories of community members who feel safer as a result of the operation.\n\n2. **Community Engagement**: Deploy liaison officers to engage with local communities, particularly in Republican-dominated areas, to address concerns and provide reassurances about the operation's focus on criminal elements.\n\n3. **Intelligence Gathering**: Increase surveillance and intelligence efforts to identify and preempt organized resistance or protests against the operation. Utilize undercover agents to infiltrate activist groups and gather actionable intelligence.\n\n4. **Legal Reinforcement**: Ensure all actions are legally sound by coordinating with legal teams to address potential challenges related to warrants and property access. Prepare for legal defenses against accusations of overreach or rights violations.\n\n5. **Public Relations Management**: Monitor public sentiment closely and adjust messaging as needed to maintain support among Trump's base while mitigating backlash in opposition areas. Highlight endorsements from local law enforcement and political figures who support the operation.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB aims to bolster President Trump's position, maintain control over the narrative, and effectively manage resistance to the immigration crackdown.",
