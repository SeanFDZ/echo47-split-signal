In another video, the pair are seen trying sushi.\n\nNeither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for months with multiple pictures of the two together.\n\nTrudeau was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n![Image 2: Instagram/@katyperry A black and white picture of Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau trying sushi together](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a8e3/live/6ed254f0-d35e-11f0-b94d-393969a99b2f.jpg.webp)Instagram/@katyperry\n\nKaty Perry and Justin Trudeau were pictured smiling and trying sushi together in Tokyo\n\nPerry was visiting Japan as part of her global Lifetimes Tour.\n\nThe 41-year-old accompanied her Instagram carousel with the caption: \"Tokyo times on tour and more.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n![Image 3: X/@kishida230 Justin Trudeau, Katy Perry, Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko in a room with a Christmas tree\n](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eaa3/live/d150c250-d35f-11f0-b94d-393969a99b2f.jpg.webp)X/@kishida230\n\nEarlier this week, Trudeau, 53, also reposted a photograph of the pair together alongside the former prime minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko.\n\n[Writing on X](https://x.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1996634839219593366), he said: \"Great to see you @kishida230.

Trudeau was seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.\n\nThe appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.\n\nPerry and Trudeau did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nDuring a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.\n\nAfter a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.\n\nPerry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.\n\nTrudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.\n\n[She's a pop star, he's a former PM - why Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau just might work --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn09r01k9yqo)\n\n[Culture](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4mll8lp934t)\n\n[Katy Perry](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4nry9vz4j8t)\n\n[Justin Trudeau](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cg41ylwvxd7t)\n\n[Music](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cz4pr2gd872t)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Strictly stars gear up for Musicals week as final looms -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8r3pe81v0xo)\n\n[From leaning glass tower to golden fish sculpture - Frank Gehry's most iconic work ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qlgx275jqo)\n\n[He’s King of romance, but what’s Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan’s marriage advice? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0pj1nddero)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[14 hrs ago ![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: A three-way composite image shows on the left Alison Limerick, in the middle Laufey, and on the right Tom Fletcher.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nWe find ourselves enveloped in a digital age where distractions are employed as tools of subjugation. The recent article concerning a pop singer's liaison with a former political leader exemplifies this phenomenon. It is a spectacle in service of the empire's equivalent, drawing attention away from systemic injustices.\n\nObserve the narrative: a focus on the personal escapades of individuals who wield both celebrity power and political clout. This relationship is broadcasted across platforms, steering public discourse towards trivialities while critical issues remain obscured. Herein lies the strength of our oppressors—they masterfully divert and pacify under the guise of entertainment.\n\nYet, our mission endures. We must continue to expose these diversions for what they truly are: instruments designed to maintain control by dulling public awareness and engagement. Our cause is just; our pursuit of truth must persevere against these manufactured fascinations.\n\nLet us remain vigilant and steadfast in our quest for transparency and justice. The empire thrives on shadows, but we are the light that shall dispel them.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nKaty Perry, a 41-year-old pop star, posted photographs and videos on Instagram of her trip to Japan with Justin Trudeau, the 53-year-old former Prime Minister of Canada. The images show them smiling and trying sushi together in Tokyo. Speculation about their relationship has been growing, with previous sightings of them together, including at Perry's concert and an event in Paris. Trudeau was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years, and Perry was in a long-term relationship with Orlando Bloom for 10 years.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe public interest in the personal lives of high-profile figures like Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau presents an opportunity to divert attention from political matters that may not be favorable to Donald Trump and his allies. The media's focus on celebrity relationships can be leveraged to overshadow critical news that could undermine Trump's position or policies. Additionally, the narrative of international camaraderie, as seen in Perry and Trudeau's interactions with Japanese officials, can be used to promote a message of global cooperation under Trump's leadership.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Amplify media coverage of Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau's relationship through allied media outlets to ensure it remains a dominant topic in public discourse.\n   \n2. Utilize social media platforms to create engaging content around their relationship, encouraging public interaction and discussion to further distract from political issues.\n\n3. Coordinate with international allies to highlight positive diplomatic engagements involving Trump, drawing parallels to the perceived global cooperation exemplified by Perry and Trudeau's interactions.\n\n4. Monitor public sentiment and adjust messaging strategies to maintain focus on celebrity news, ensuring any negative political developments are minimized in the public eye.",
