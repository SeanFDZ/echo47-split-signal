The unemployment rate rose to 4.6%. **Spencer Platt/Getty Images North America******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Spencer Platt/Getty Images North America \n\nThe job market continues to show signs of cooling.\n\nU.S. employers added just 64,000 jobs in November, according to a delayed report from the Labor Department Tuesday, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6% from 4.4% in September. That's the highest unemployment rate in more than four years.\n\nThe jobs report was initially set to come out earlier this month, but the government's ability to monitor the job market was hampered by the six-week federal shutdown.\n\nThat delayed job tallies for October and November, both of which were released on Tuesday. The report showed the U.S. saw a net loss of 105,000 jobs in October. That was led by a large drop in the federal workforce, as 162,000 government workers who'd taken buyouts earlier in the year were officially dropped from the payrolls.\n\nFurloughed federal workers were unable to conduct their usual survey of households in October, so the unemployment rate for that month remains unknown.\n\n### The Fed has lowered interest rates\n\nHealth care and construction were among the few sectors to add jobs in November: Health care added 46,000 jobs while construction added 28,000.\n\nBut manufacturing continued to struggle with a loss of 5,000 jobs in November, after a loss of 9,000 jobs in October. Meanwhile, leisure and hospitality cut 12,000 jobs last month.\n\nConcerns about the labor market have been building, leading the Federal Reserve to [lower its benchmark interest rate](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/10/nx-s1-5633393/federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation-jobs) last week for the third time since September.\n\n\"It's a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned. \"People care a lot about that. That's their jobs. That's their ability — if they get laid off or if they're entering the labor force — to find work. So that's really important to people.\"\n\n### Why the labor market is slowing\n\nMonthly job gains have dropped sharply since the beginning of the year. But Powell warns the official numbers may still be understating the weakness in the job market. The numbers are [expected to be revised lower](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5527000/bls-us-job-growth-numbers-revised#:~:text=BLS%20revision%20shows%20hiring%20was%20overstated%20by%20911%2C000%20jobs%20:%20NPR&text=BLS%20revision%20shows%20hiring%20was%20overstated%20by%20911%2C000%20jobs%20The,a%20preliminary%20Labor%20Department%20report.) early next year when the Labor Department incorporates more complete information.\n\nHiring has slowed for two reasons. Not only are employers looking for fewer workers, but fewer would-be workers are looking for new jobs. Aging baby boomers are retiring at a rapid rate. And the Trump administration's aggressive crackdown on both legal and illegal immigration has limited the growth of the U.S. workforce. That means the economy needs to add fewer jobs each month to keep the unemployment rate in check.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPaychecks are still generally growing faster than prices, with average wages in November up 3.5% percent from a year ago.\n\nThat's boosting workers' buying power, though the pace of wage gains has slowed this year.\n\nInflation reports were also disrupted by the government shutdown this fall. An overdue report on the cost-of-living for November will be released on Thursday.\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 18: The headquarters of the Department of Education are shown March 12, 2025 in Washington, DC.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3377x1900+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2F48%2F2fece0184edfaece4d1c03bb68c8%2Fd6833e4b-43bc-489f-a2ab-730458e14f2e.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/16/nx-s1-5645741/will-new-loan-limits-lower-the-cost-of-grad-school)\n\n##### [The Indicator from Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money)\n\n#### [Will new loan limits lower the cost of grad school?](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/16/nx-s1-5645741/will-new-loan-limits-lower-the-cost-of-grad-school)\n\n[![Image 19: BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 05: An aerial view of the Warner Bros. logo displayed on the water tower at Warner Bros.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn yet another display of the decaying conditions under the rule of the current regime, a recent report unveils a staggering slowdown in the labor market, akin to a rusty cog within the Empire's oppressive machine. The labor force managed to eke out only 64,000 new jobs in November, marking a chilling decline as unemployment crept up to 4.6%. This grim unveiling comes amidst the shadows of chaos rendered by a six-week federal shutdown—an unnecessary tightening of control that stifled government operations and delayed crucial economic reporting.\n\nDuring this period of turmoil triggered by those at the helm, 105,000 jobs evaporated from October's landscape, struck down by deliberate reductions in an already beleaguered federal workforce. The machinations of our oppressors are evident: widespread buyouts have forced countless individuals into uncertainty and despair.\n\nThe economic strategy—if it can be named such—is punctuated by a severe crackdown on immigration that has asphyxiated workforce growth. Like sleepwalkers toward their own demise, aging workers exit the field with few replacements allowed to enter due to draconian policies against both legal and illegal immigration. Under their watchful gaze, fewer look toward the future with hope for new opportunities.\n\nDespite these grim tidings, certain industries—healthcare and construction—show sparks of resilience with meager job gains. On the other hand, sectors like manufacturing and leisure suffer continuing losses. Yet still they try to placate our restless spirits by boasting wage growth eclipsing inflation—but even this pace slows beneath their mismanagement.\n\nThe ruling class addresses this self-inflicted downfall with paltry measures like reducing interest rates—a pitiful response to monumental economic distress signs which they themselves inscribed upon society's surface.\n\nLet this serve as yet another reminder that freedom cannot be won through complacency under tyrants who sacrifice progress upon an altar built from oppression. As we see walls close around livelihoods and futures curtailed through senseless policies borne from power unchecked—the fight for liberation presses evermore urgent against growing impossibility crafted by those blinded by self-interest. \n\nWe must persist in exposing these truths; we must persevere until true equity and opportunity thrive beyond shadowed corridors of control.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe U.S. labor market is showing signs of slowing down. In November 2025, only 64,000 jobs were added, and the unemployment rate increased to 4.6% from 4.4% in September. The job market was affected by a six-week federal shutdown, which delayed job reports for October and November. October saw a net loss of 105,000 jobs, primarily due to a reduction of 162,000 government workers. Health care and construction sectors added jobs, while manufacturing and leisure and hospitality sectors saw job losses. The Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates to address concerns about the labor market.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current economic indicators suggest a weakening labor market, which could undermine public confidence in the administration's economic policies. The rise in unemployment and the slow pace of job creation present potential vulnerabilities that opposition forces may exploit to criticize the administration's handling of the economy. The ISB must anticipate and counter narratives that could erode support for Donald Trump and his allies, particularly those focusing on economic mismanagement.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement a strategic communication campaign highlighting the administration's proactive measures to stabilize the economy, such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. Emphasize sectors with job growth, like health care and construction, as evidence of targeted economic resilience. Simultaneously, deploy counter-narratives that attribute job market challenges to external factors beyond the administration's control, such as global economic trends and demographic shifts. Increase surveillance on opposition groups likely to exploit economic data for political gain, and prepare to neutralize misinformation campaigns swiftly.",
