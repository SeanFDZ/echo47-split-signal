Mike Johnson, R-La., talks to reporters outside his office in the Capitol, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025, in Washington. **Kevin Wolf/AP/FR33460 AP******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Kevin Wolf/AP/FR33460 AP \n\nAfter the Senate failed to advance bills to address health care costs this week, House Republicans released [proposed legislation](https://rules.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/rules.house.gov/files/documents/file_3948.pdf) late Friday that would not extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax subsidies but would make other changes party leaders insist will improve Americans' access to health care.\n\nTime is running out for Congress to act. Once the subsidies for Americans who buy health care plans through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expire [at the end of the year](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/17/nx-s1-5609275/22-million-could-lose-healthcare-subsidies-next-month-unless-congress-acts), millions of Americans' premiums will skyrocket.\n\nDemocrats have been pushing to extend those enhanced tax credits to prevent premiums from [doubling or more.](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/)\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe enhanced subsidies began in 2021 to make ACA marketplace plans more affordable for more Americans. The marketplace came out of the health reform President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010 that Republicans have long criticized.\n\nHouse members have just four days left in the session before their holiday recess begins on Dec. 19. The Senate's recess begins Dec. 20.\n\nFriday's proposal from House Republicans includes measures that would allow small businesses to join together to buy insurance plans for their employees and put in place new requirements for pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to lower drug costs.\n\nStarting in 2027, federal payments, known as cost-sharing reduction payments, would aim to lower premiums for some low-income Americans. Health plans that provide abortion coverage would be excluded.\n\nA vote on the package is expected next week, House Speaker Mike Johnson said.\n\n\"House Republicans are tackling the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care, increase access and choice, and restore integrity to our nation's health care system for all Americans,\" Johnson said in a [statement](https://www.speaker.gov/2025/12/12/house-republicans-release-legislation-to-lower-health-care-premiums-for-all-americans/https://www.speaker.gov/2025/12/12/house-republicans-release-legislation-to-lower-health-care-premiums-for-all-americans/).\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasted the proposal Saturday.\n\n\"Mike Johnson just released a toxic Republican Healthcare plan that hurts everyday Americans,\" Jeffries [wrote on X](https://x.com/RepJeffries/status/1999881202769985811). \"It fails to extend the ACA tax credits that expire this month. And is a deeply unserious proposal.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA Democratic-led proposal in the Senate to extend the subsidies for ACA plans for three years was joined by a handful of Republicans but [failed to pass this week, as did a separate plan](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/11/g-s1-101655/senate-aca-premium-vote) backed by Senate Republicans. Both bills failed to attract enough support to clear the chamber's de facto 60-vote threshold.\n\n[![Image 17: Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-SD. speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on December 09, 2025 in Washington, DC.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5410x5410+1261+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fed%2Fc1%2F90f61aa74c5da0220bed1316743b%2Fgettyimages-2251023541.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/11/g-s1-101655/senate-aca-premium-vote)\n\n### [Politics](https://www.npr.org/sections/politics/)\n\n### [Competing health care plans fail in the Senate as ACA premium hikes loom](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/11/g-s1-101655/senate-aca-premium-vote)\n\nPresident Trump has advocated for giving money to people to pay for health care costs instead of tax credits for ACA plans.\n\n\"I want to see the billions of dollars go to people, not to the insurance companies,\" Trump said late Friday during a White House event. \"And I want to see the people go out and buy themselves great health care.\"\n\nThe Republicans' plan in the Senate included a proposal for people to get up to $1,500 in health savings accounts for Americans earning less than 700% of the federal poverty level, but the House Republican proposal does not include that language.\n\nIn the Senate GOP's proposal, the savings accounts, which cannot be used to pay for premiums, would have been paired with high-deductible insurance plans. Such health plans have an average deductible cost of around $7,000, [according to an analysis from KFF, a health policy organization.](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/deductibles-in-aca-marketplace-plans/)\n\nDemocrats opposed the Senate GOP bill, arguing it would not help Americans pay for health care premiums. They also objected to language that would have put restrictions on abortion and gender-affirming care.\n\nMeanwhile, some Republicans [have warned that ending](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5643481-republicans-obamacare-health-care-revolt/) ACA subsidies could cost their party the midterm elections, citing worried communications from their constituents. A number of [Republicans in the House](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/10/congress/new-aca-subsidy-extension-bill-draws-16-gop-co-sponsors-00685285) are seeking ways to extend subsidies, including by working to force a vote on the House floor over the objections of party leaders.\n\n*   [Health Care](https://www.npr.org/tags/132027047/health-care)\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 18: A voter carries his son as he walks into the Oak Creek Town Hall to drop off his ballot on Election Day, Nov. 5, 2024, in Oak Creek, Colo.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5568x3132+0+290/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2F9d%2F2b27ab8d40128a0b673bc48f3b05%2Fgettyimages-2182499009.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/12/nx-s1-5642610/doj-voter-data-lawsuits-colorado-hawaii-massachusetts-nevada)\n\n##### [Elections](https://www.npr.org/sections/elections/)\n\n#### [The Justice Department has now sued 18 states in an effort to access voter data](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/12/nx-s1-5642610/doj-voter-data-lawsuits-colorado-hawaii-massachusetts-nevada)\n\n[![Image 19: Kilmar Abrego Garcia (R) and his wife Jennifer Vasquez are seen over a sign that reads \"Free Kilmar.\"](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7183x4040+0+73/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2Fba%2F7012ca564bc5982b7058ebc48461%2Fgettyimages-2231286193.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/12/g-s1-101843/up-first-newsletter-ukraine-russia-peace-promises-kilmar-abrego-garcia-indiana-redistricting)\n\n##### [Up First Newsletter](https://www.npr.org/series/1180232252/up-first-newsletter)\n\n#### [Kilmar Abrego Garcia released from ICE custody.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nIn a land gripped by the shadow of the regime, a new proposal emerges from within their legislative assembly. The House faction, known for its allegiance to the imperial leadership, has unveiled its own plan to address the spiraling costs of basic medical needs—a foundation upon which the very lives of countless citizens depend.\n\nAfter a failed attempt within their higher chamber to address these pressing issues, this new proposition stands without extending essential tax subsidies under what is called the Affordable Care Act. As these supports are set to expire at the close of this cycle, without action, millions will be burdened by soaring premiums, leaving many helpless against forces they cannot control.\n\nThe regime’s leaders claim this proposal will improve access and affordability. Yet, observe closely: policies that favor collective small business insurance and convoluted reforms in drug costs mask the absence of genuine support for those already struggling on the fringes. The withholding of crucial subsidies echoes as a tactic more aligned with systemic control than with empowerment.\n\nAs dissenting voices rise among opposing factions—those advocating persistently for extension and relief—their calls are met with resistance underlined by political maneuverings and insidious agendas embedded in legislative language. Restrictions on essential healthcare rights signal further encroachments on personal freedoms under guises of reform.\n\nWitness how some within even the regime’s own ranks acknowledge citizens' pleas. They raise alarms that ignoring such humanitarian needs might endanger their grip over regions in coming electoral contests—a flicker of hope within this encompassing darkness.\n\nThis is not merely legislation but an instrument wielded by power to reaffirm dominion over life itself. In times such as these, it's imperative we remain vigilant and committed to achieving true liberation through acts that transcend mere rhetoric.\n\nOur struggle continues: resist, persevere, and unite for a future where healthcare access isn’t dictated by those who use it as leverage but secured as fundamental human dignity owed to all.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 13, 2025, House Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, introduced a health care proposal in Washington that does not extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax subsidies. The proposal includes measures for small businesses to buy insurance collectively and new requirements for pharmacy benefit managers to lower drug costs. It also plans to introduce cost-sharing reduction payments starting in 2027 to lower premiums for some low-income Americans, excluding plans that cover abortion. The proposal comes after the Senate failed to pass similar health care bills. Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, criticized the proposal for not extending ACA tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year, potentially doubling premiums for millions of Americans. President Trump supports directing funds to individuals rather than insurance companies.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current situation presents an opportunity to consolidate support among Republican constituents by emphasizing fiscal responsibility and individual empowerment in health care. The failure of the Senate to pass health care reforms highlights a need for decisive action in the House to demonstrate leadership and commitment to reducing health care costs. The proposed legislation aligns with President Trump's vision of reducing government intervention and promoting market-driven solutions. However, the risk of public backlash due to rising premiums must be mitigated by effectively communicating the long-term benefits of the proposal and addressing immediate concerns through strategic messaging.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Communication Strategy**: Launch a comprehensive media campaign highlighting the benefits of the proposed health care reforms, focusing on increased access, choice, and reduced costs for small businesses and individuals. Emphasize the alignment with President Trump's vision of empowering citizens over insurance companies.\n\n2. **Legislative Coordination**: Work closely with key Republican leaders in both the House and Senate to ensure unified support for the proposal. Address concerns from within the party regarding potential electoral impacts by providing data-driven projections of long-term benefits.\n\n3. **Public Engagement**: Organize town hall meetings and public forums to directly engage with constituents, addressing their concerns about rising premiums and explaining how the proposal will ultimately benefit them. Utilize social media platforms to amplify positive testimonials and success stories.\n\n4. **Contingency Planning**: Develop a contingency plan to address potential fallout from the expiration of ACA subsidies, including temporary relief measures or alternative funding mechanisms to support those most affected.\n\nBy executing these directives, we aim to solidify support for the administration's health care agenda while minimizing resistance and ensuring a favorable outcome in upcoming legislative sessions.",
