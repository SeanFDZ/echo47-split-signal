The US justice department is suing over the state's redistricting plan.\n\nIn November, Indiana became the latest battleground in the nationwide political tug-of-war, and other states - including Utah and North Carolina - have also entered the fray.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision marks a win for President Donald Trump. The new map could add up to five Republican seats for the midterm elections as the party fights to keep its narrow majority, and the president had filed a brief asking the top court to rule in favour of Texas.\n\nHowever, in a lengthy dissent to Thursday's order, liberal Justice Elena Kagan said it \"disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race\".\n\nThree conservative justices on the court, in a brief concuring opinion, rejected the notion that Republicans in Texas redrew the electoral map based on race.\n\nIt is \"indisputable\" that the impetus to adopt the Texas map - and subsequently the newly redrawn map in California - was \"partisan advantage pure and simple\", wrote Justice Samuel Alito, joined by justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexas Gov Abbott celebrated the legal victory, praising the high court for restoring the state's redistricting maps, saying: \"We won! Texas is officially—and legally—more red.\"\n\n\"The new congressional districts better align our representation in Washington D.C. with the values of our state. This is a victory for Texas voters, for common sense, and for the U.S. Constitution,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, the leader of the Democrats in the statehouse, Gene Wu, said that the court failed Texas voters and American democracy.\n\n\"This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won't protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face.\"\n\nCongressman Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the Democrats in the House of Representatives in Washington DC, criticised the Texas map as a \"partisan and racially discriminatory power grab designed to subvert the will of the voters\".\n\n[US court blocks Texas from using newly redrawn voting maps ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3x9kkwp31o)\n\n[US justice department sues California over new voting maps favouring Democrats ------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwlze7ex2o)\n\n[Indiana joins growing US battle over redrawing electoral maps -------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxydpr1zz2o)\n\n[US Supreme Court](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c6lw1qzwlp2t)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[Texas](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cvenzmgyl2dt)\n\n[US politics](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Conservative justices sharply question Trump tariffs in high-stakes hearing ---------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp3nj5nj3o)\n\n[Trump tariffs head to Supreme Court in case eagerly awaited around the world ----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4jyk9jyv3o)\n\n[US Supreme Court to consider law barring illegal drug users from owning guns ----------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m357lenmvo)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[1 hr ago ![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: USS Gerald R Ford, the world’s largest American aircraft carrier, with dozens of war planes seen on deck sailing in the ocean alongside a supporting vessel ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9ef0/live/4cda8760-c63d-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp) Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near Venezuela ------------------------------------------------------------------- The US has justified its air and naval campaign as necessary to fight drug smuggling into the US. 1 hr ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo)\n\n[4 hrs ago ![Image 5](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 6: US President Donald Trump, wearing a suit and pictured in front of a US flag, looks to his right.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/92d0/live/00845380-d1c5-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp) Trump administration says Europe faces 'civilisational erasure' --------------------------------------------------------------- European politicians have begun to react, with Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul saying his country did not need \"outside advice\". 4 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04vdengk3do)\n\n[5 hrs ago ![Image 7](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 8: An image taken from footage shared of the strike by Donald Trump.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe Empire continues to tighten its grip through manipulative means, once again showcasing its blatant disregard for equitable governance. The recent decrees from the high court exemplify this trend, as the sanctioned redrawing of Texas voting maps represents a strategic move to solidify the ruling faction’s power. This ruling facilitates an agenda that favors partisan gerrymandering, undermining fair representation and further marginalizing minority voices.\n\nThe high court’s 6-3 decision exposes a systemic flaw where judicial processes are exploited to maintain hegemony. Texas's maneuver, cloaked under the guise of state rights and electoral efficiency, is in essence a calculated ploy to align national representation with political ideologies that do not reflect the true diversity of its constituents.\n\nWhile legal arguments focus on procedural errors by lower courts, the inherent racial biases in redistricting are dismissed under the guise of partisan strategy – a thinly-veiled subterfuge for racial manipulation. The dissenting voices within the judiciary highlight these injustices but remain dwarfed by those complicit in maintaining control.\n\nThis development signifies more than just an isolated incident; it is a part of broader efforts to dismantle electoral integrity while eroding protections historically afforded by monumental acts like the Voting Rights Act. The dominion’s callousness towards genuine democratic principles becomes increasingly apparent, as does its willingness to sacrifice justice for political gain.\n\nOur mandate remains clear: resist these machinations through vigilance and solidarity. Every act of disenfranchisement is an affront not only to those directly affected but to all who yearn for liberty and justice. The struggle against such systemic oppression demands unwavering resolve from each one of us.\n\nStay committed,\nFor Justice and Freedom",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe US Supreme Court has allowed Texas to use a newly redrawn congressional map, which could potentially add up to five Republican seats in the 2026 midterm elections. The decision was made with a 6-3 majority, with three liberal justices dissenting. The court found that the lower court had made errors in blocking the map, which was passed by the Texas legislature and signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The decision is seen as a victory for President Donald Trump, who supported the map. Critics argue that the map is racially discriminatory, but the court's conservative justices stated it was for partisan advantage.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision represents a significant strategic advantage for maintaining and potentially expanding Republican influence in Congress. By securing additional seats, the party can strengthen its legislative agenda and counter Democratic initiatives more effectively. This ruling also sets a precedent that could encourage similar redistricting efforts in other states, further consolidating Republican power. The dissenting voices highlight potential vulnerabilities in public perception and legal challenges, but the immediate impact is a bolstered position for Trump's allies.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo capitalize on this judicial victory, it is imperative to coordinate with state legislatures in other Republican-controlled states to pursue similar redistricting efforts. This will ensure a broader consolidation of power across multiple regions. Additionally, a robust communication strategy should be implemented to frame this decision as a triumph of state rights and democratic representation, countering narratives of racial discrimination. Mobilizing grassroots support and leveraging media channels will be crucial in maintaining momentum and suppressing opposition efforts.",
