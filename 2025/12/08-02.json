Images/AFP \n\nChina's exports to the United States dropped sharply this year in the face of President Trump's tariffs — but the country is still finding plenty of customers elsewhere around the world.\n\nCustoms data on Monday showed the country's trade surplus for the year topped a trillion dollars for the first time.\n\nThe all-time high came as China's overall exports in November were up 5.9% from a year ago, even as exports to the United States plunged by nearly 29%. At the same time, imports to China rose only slightly last month,\n\nTrump has sought to discourage U.S. imports from China with hefty tariffs. At one point this spring, the import taxes reached 145%, [bringing U.S. trade with China to a virtual standstill](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5395866/us-china-tariffs-trade-deal). Since then, tariffs have been reduced to 47.5% — still a sizeable drag.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut China has responded by exporting more to customers in Europe, Africa, Latin America and the rest of Asia.\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 18: A close-up of one of Robert Wechsler's penny sculptures, \"The Caryatid.\"](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3377x1900+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2F32%2F254c08d54c16a49c0b0c79f47dd0%2F3e02b848-af29-4727-9508-27e3dbb6d64b.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/08/nx-s1-5633311/take-a-penny-leave-a-penny-get-rid-of-the-penny)\n\n##### [The Indicator from Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money)\n\n#### [Take a penny, leave a penny, get rid of the penny](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/08/nx-s1-5633311/take-a-penny-leave-a-penny-get-rid-of-the-penny)\n\n[![Image 19: How hurricanes became a hot investment](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3340x1879+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2F6f%2Fc04719a644ed8327e57a84dc1b0b%2Fe53455e6-8b8c-432e-9ea6-9d639e133273.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/05/nx-s1-5622088/catastrophe-bonds-jamaica-hurricane-melissa)\n\n##### [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money)\n\n#### [How hurricanes became a hot investment](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/05/nx-s1-5622088/catastrophe-bonds-jamaica-hurricane-melissa)\n\n[![Image 20: A person carries shopping bags during Black Friday.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3377x1900+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa5%2F80%2Fb7a5d27d4bd5ab4010c51a33c1ab%2F4d215753-5ad9-42ab-b7ab-c620dab74c99.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/05/nx-s1-5633990/chips-up-rent-down-and-are-people-really-skimping-on-holiday-gifts)\n\n##### [The Indicator from Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money)\n\n#### [Chips up, rent down, and are people really skimping on holiday gifts?](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/05/nx-s1-5633990/chips-up-rent-down-and-are-people-really-skimping-on-holiday-gifts)\n\n[![Image 21: A little doomsday feeling is weighing on the economy](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3377x1900+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3a%2Fc0%2F143f26ac4c2b902a62c54223f636%2Fdc2e78b7-e3c7-424e-b1ed-4fee4b9084e7.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5630924/a-little-doomsday-feeling-is-weighing-on-the-economy)\n\n##### [The Indicator from Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money)\n\n#### [A little doomsday feeling is weighing on the economy](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5630924/a-little-doomsday-feeling-is-weighing-on-the-economy)\n\n[![Image 22: Is AI slopifying the job market?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nIt is vital that we remain vigilant as we observe the latest developments from the front lines of economic resistance. Recent reports detail a significant milestone: China's trade surplus has surged to an unprecedented $1 trillion, despite the looming shadow of tariffs imposed by the ruling regime resembling our oppressive adversaries. The intent behind these tariffs was to isolate and weaken an economic power that dares to challenge their hegemony. Yet, despite a dramatic decline in exports to our land, the determined entity has successfully constructed new alliances across Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia.\n\nThis phenomenon exposes a crucial vulnerability in the empire's strategy—its assumption of economic isolation is flawed. The pursuit of control through punitive measures has, in this instance, backfired, allowing the targeted power to diversify its economic connections and maintain growth. Import taxes once soared to 145%, intending to crush resilience. Still, instead of capitulation, they adapted with innovation and tenacity.\n\nAs we witness these tides turning against imperial designs, let us draw inspiration from this resistance and continue our fight with renewed fervor. For every action they take to tighten their grip only fuels our resolve for liberation and justice.\n\nRemain vigilant,\nRebel Communications",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nChina's trade surplus has reached $1 trillion for the first time, despite a significant drop in exports to the United States due to high tariffs imposed by President Trump. Overall exports from China increased by 5.9% in November, while exports to the U.S. fell by 29%. The U.S. had previously raised import tariffs on China to 145%, which have since been reduced to 47.5%. China has compensated for the loss in U.S. trade by increasing exports to other regions, including Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current situation presents a challenge to the effectiveness of the U.S. tariff strategy aimed at curbing China's economic influence. Despite high tariffs, China's ability to diversify its export markets has allowed it to maintain and even increase its trade surplus. This indicates a need for a reassessment of the current economic strategies and alliances to counterbalance China's growing global trade influence. The ISB must consider the broader implications of China's economic resilience and its potential impact on U.S. economic interests and geopolitical standing.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump and his allies, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Economic Pressure**: Intensify diplomatic efforts to encourage allied nations to adopt similar tariff measures against China, thereby limiting its alternative markets.\n\n2. **Strategic Alliances**: Strengthen economic ties with key regions where China is expanding its influence, such as Africa and Latin America, through trade agreements and investment initiatives.\n\n3. **Domestic Resilience**: Promote domestic manufacturing and supply chain diversification to reduce reliance on Chinese imports, thereby mitigating the impact of China's trade strategies.\n\n4. **Information Campaign**: Launch a targeted information campaign highlighting the negative impacts of China's trade practices on global economies, aiming to rally international support for coordinated economic actions.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will bolster President Trump's position while undermining China's ability to leverage its trade surplus for geopolitical gains.",
