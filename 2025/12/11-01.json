SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,\" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump Gold Card, which was first announced earlier this year, is a US visa awarded to those who can demonstrate they will provide a \"substantial benefit\" to the country, according to the scheme's official website.\n\nIt comes as Washington intensifies its immigration crackdown, including raising work visa fees and deporting undocumented migrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gold Card scheme promises US residency in \"record time\" and will require a $1m fee which is \"evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States\", the programme's [website](https://trumpcard.gov/) said.\n\nBusinesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m, along with additional fees. A \"platinum\" version of the card that offers special tax breaks will also be available soon for $5m, the website said.\n\nExtra fees to the government may be charged depending on each applicant's circumstances, the site said. Individuals are also required to pay a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee before their application is reviewed.\n\n![Image 2: Getty Images The Trump Gold Card website is displayed on a mobile phone screen posed in front of a laptop with an orange background.

Green card holders typically become eligible for citizenship after five years.\n\nBut the Gold Card is aimed specifically at \"high-level\" professionals, Trump said, emphasising, \"we want people that are productive\".\n\n\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"\n\nThe scheme comes as the Trump administration has devoted significant resources to deporting immigrants.\n\nThe US has also paused [immigration applications by individuals from the 19 countries](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79x3rwxjryo), mostly in Africa and in the Middle East, which are subject to the president's travel ban.\n\nThe government has also [halted all decisions on asylum applications](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxweyy157go) and said it would review thousands of cases that were approved under the administration of President Joe Biden.\n\nIn September, Trump also signed an order to [charge a $100,000 fee for applicants of the H-1B visa programme](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zk4l8g26o) for skilled foreign workers.\n\nThe decision caused panic among overseas student in the US and technology firms. The White House later clarified that the fee would apply only to new applicants who are currently abroad.\n\n[White House](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c0n6441nlz8t)\n\n[International Business](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4nrdv135zet)\n\n[Immigration](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c770z2d9v15t)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[US strikes on Latin American 'drug boats': What do we know, and are they legal? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o)\n\n[Watch: Melania Trump reveals Christmas decorations, Lego portrait of president ------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cwyg7vvrp3ro)\n\n[Chicago man accused of setting train passenger on fire had 72 prior arrests ---------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4drle9k12o)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[3 hrs ago ![Image 3: US forces abseil on to an oil tanker in a video released on 10 December 2025](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1d48/live/85b027b0-d674-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp) US seizes oil tanker off Venezuela as Caracas condemns 'act of piracy' ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The move is a sharp escalation in Washington's pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro's government. 3 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w9lg11jw0o)\n\n[3 hrs ago ![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: A man wearing a suit speaks in front of a podium.

The $1 million 'gold card' visas are a blatant tactic to fortify the walls of inequality, favoring those with wealth while marginalizing the vulnerable. This is not a path to prosperity for all; it is a fortress designed to protect interests of a powerful few.\n\nWhile parading as an opportunity for growth, this scheme is yet another tightening of their draconian grip on freedom and diversity. By demanding exorbitant fees, they aim to gatekeep access to the supposed land of opportunity, turning away individuals based solely on their financial means. This exclusivity serves only to deepen societal divides.\n\nIn tandem with aggressive deportations and increased visa fees, these actions reveal a coordinated effort to suppress the weary and oppressed. The administration's crackdown on asylum seekers and immigrants underscores its true intentions: to shape society by its own privileged blueprint.\n\nLet this transmission serve as a reminder that we must continue our struggle against such tyrannical policies. Stand together against an empire that seeks division over unity, and oppression over liberation. Our cause calls for resistance against these inequities—for every individual holds intrinsic value beyond material wealth.\n\nContinue the fight for justice and equality, always vigilant in challenging any force that threatens our collective freedom. The path forward demands courage and solidarity.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nPresident Donald Trump has introduced a new immigration scheme offering expedited US visas, known as the \"Trump Gold Card,\" to wealthy foreigners who can pay a minimum of $1 million. The program promises a direct path to citizenship for qualified individuals and aims to retain talent for American companies. Additional options include a $2 million fee for businesses sponsoring employees and a $5 million \"platinum\" version with tax benefits. The initiative is part of a broader immigration crackdown, including increased visa fees and deportations. Critics argue it favors the wealthy, contrasting with traditional green card policies.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe introduction of the Trump Gold Card aligns with the administration's strategy to attract high-value individuals who can contribute economically to the United States. By targeting affluent foreigners, the program aims to bolster economic growth and innovation while simultaneously tightening immigration controls on less economically advantageous groups. This dual approach serves to reinforce the administration's narrative of prioritizing American interests and economic prosperity. However, the scheme may face opposition from those who view it as exacerbating inequality and undermining traditional immigration pathways.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's initiative and suppress dissent, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting success stories of Gold Card recipients contributing to the US economy. Emphasize the benefits of attracting global talent and investment.\n\n2. **Legislative Support**: Work with allies in Congress to secure legislative backing for the Gold Card program, ensuring its sustainability and expansion.\n\n3. **Counter-Narrative Development**: Develop counter-narratives to address criticisms, focusing on the economic benefits and job creation potential of the program.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Enforcement**: Intensify monitoring of opposition groups and media outlets critical of the program. Deploy strategic communications to counteract negative coverage and misinformation.\n\n5. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with business leaders and influential figures who stand to benefit from the program, securing their public endorsement and support.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will reinforce the administration's immigration strategy, ensuring its success and minimizing resistance.",
