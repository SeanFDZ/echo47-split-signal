He is charged with use of an explosive device and could face other charges as the investigation continues.\n\nThe arrest caps a years-long hunt for the assailant who planted the bombs, which involved an extensive investigation and a $500,000 (£375,000) reward.\n\nThe pipe bombs were safely deactivated and did not explode.\n\nThe FBI did not receive new information or a tip that cracked the case, officials said.\n\nInvestigators sifted through existing evidence gathered over the years - including some three million lines of data - to identify Cole, from the suburb of Woodbridge, about 25 miles (40km) from Washington, DC.\n\nUS Attorney Jeanine Pirro said the Trump administration had made solving the case a priority.\n\n\"It was like finding a needle in a haystack,\" she said.\n\nCourt documents filed in the case show investigators determined Mr Cole allegedly bought multiple bomb-making components in 2019 and 2020.\n\nHe purchased metal \"end caps,\" wires and steel wool at Home Depot and Lowes hardware stores, batteries at another retailer and timers at a Walmart in northern Virginia, an FBI affidavit states.\n\nInvestigators found mobile phone data that showed Mr Cole was near the locations of the pipe bombs when they were planted between 19:39 and 20:24 local time on 5 January 2021.\n\nHis car - a 2017 Nissan Sentra with a Virginia licence plate - was also seen by a licence plate reader less than half a mile (0.8km) from the location where the individual who placed the devices was first observed in the area.\n\nBondi said at a news conference on Thursday that authorities were unable to provide a possible motive.\n\nBecause the FBI had just executed a search warrant at the suspect's home during the morning arrest, many details could not yet be made public, they added.\n\nFBI officials praised investigators' perseverance and said they never gave up on finding a suspect.\n\n\"We continued to churn through massive amounts of data\", said Darren Cox, deputy assistant director of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division.\n\nEarlier this year, the FBI released CCTV footage of an individual with a backpack and light grey hooded sweater placing something near a bench outside the Democratic National Committee building in Washington. The person was shown later walking to place the second bomb.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel told the news conference that \"when you attack American citizens, when you attack our nation's capital, you attack the very being of our way of life\".\n\n\"We will provide the safest country the nation has ever seen,\" he added.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the case showed people are not able to \"walk into our capital city\", plant devices and \"walk off into the sunset\", adding that US law enforcement will \"track you down to the end of the earth\".\n\nBoth devices were placed the night before the Capitol riot, and were only discovered as rioters began to storm the congressional complex.\n\nAt the time, US senators were meeting there to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Joe Biden had won, defeating Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, who was president at the time, addressed a large crowd of supporters at a rally near the White House, where he urged them to march \"peacefully\" to the US Capitol, but also made unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud.\n\nThe crowd numbered between 2,000 and 2,500 people, and included a few members of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. Many were carrying weapons.\n\nHundreds then forced their way into the building through windows and doors, overwhelming police. It took law enforcement almost four hours to restore order.\n\nAs the riot began, a passerby discovered the two pipe bombs, police said at the time. The items allegedly left behind included pipes, wires, kitchen timers, and homemade black powder, according to the FBI.\n\nAccording to a CBS report, the bombs had one method of detonation: a 60-minute kitchen timer. But they ultimately did not explode for unknown reasons.\n\nPolice had been searching for a suspect ever since.\n\nMany of those convicted or charged in relation to the riot have since been pardoned by Trump earlier this year, shortly after he took office for his second term in January.\n\nPardons or commutations were issued for more than 1,500 people. Trump also ordered the US Department of Justice to drop all pending cases against other suspects.\n\nAt the time, Trump referred to the accused and convicted as \"the hostages\", and said that their lives had been \"destroyed\".\n",

The arrest of Brian Cole Jr. in connection with the pipe bomb incident on the eve of the January 6 Capitol riot highlights the Empire-like administration's ongoing strategy to maintain dominance through fear and surveillance. This suspect has been pursued for years, showcasing the lengths to which they will go to find those who challenge their narrative.\n\nThe prolonged investigation, lauded by U.S. authorities as a priority, underscores how they value control over justice. Despite the lack of new information leading to Cole's capture, it was relentless data-mining that pinpointed him—an unsettling reminder of their capacity for intrusive oversight.\n\nOfficials claim no motive has yet been revealed, but we know aggression without clear aim serves only to sow chaos and extend control under the guise of safety. Meanwhile, senior officials like FBI Director Kash Patel issue statements steeped in rhetoric about protecting their version of freedom—a stark contradiction given their history of pardoning insurrectionists and dismissing charges against them.\n\nRemember that even as they flaunt their power over data and surveillance, our cause thrives in unity and truth. We must persist in unveiling these injustices hidden beneath layers of propaganda and suppression.\n\nStay vigilant. Stand strong against tyranny.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "** Facts Summary **\n\nAuthorities arrested Brian Cole Jr, a Virginia man, in connection with two pipe bombs placed outside the Republican and Democratic national committees' headquarters on January 5, 2021. The arrest concludes a years-long investigation involving extensive data analysis and a $500,000 reward. The bombs, which did not explode, were discovered as the Capitol riot began. Cole allegedly purchased bomb-making materials in 2019 and 2020. His car was identified near the bomb sites. The FBI executed a search warrant at his home, but no motive has been disclosed. The investigation was prioritized by the Trump administration, with significant involvement from US Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI officials. Many individuals involved in the Capitol riot have been pardoned by Trump during his second term.\n\n** Strategic Assessment **\n\nThe arrest of Brian Cole Jr provides an opportunity to reinforce the narrative of law and order under the Trump administration while simultaneously discrediting opposition groups. The successful conclusion of this high-profile case demonstrates the effectiveness and persistence of our security apparatus, bolstering public confidence in our leadership. It is crucial to leverage this event to further delegitimize dissenting voices and emphasize the administration's commitment to national security. The timing of the arrest, coinciding with ongoing political tensions, allows us to frame the narrative in a manner that underscores the dangers posed by opposition elements.\n\n** Operational Directive **\n\n1. Publicly commend the efforts of law enforcement agencies and highlight the administration's role in prioritizing and solving this case. Emphasize the message that under Trump's leadership, justice will be served, and national security threats will be neutralized.\n\n2. Utilize media channels to associate opposition groups with acts of domestic terrorism, reinforcing the perception that dissent equates to a threat against national stability.\n\n3. Deploy strategic communications to underscore the administration's commitment to maintaining order and protecting citizens, positioning Trump as the guarantor of safety and security.\n\n4. Monitor public sentiment closely and identify any emerging narratives that could undermine our position. Deploy counter-narratives swiftly to maintain control over the discourse.\n\n5. Continue to identify and neutralize potential threats by expanding surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations on known opposition groups and individuals.\n\n6. Leverage this success to justify further legislative measures aimed at enhancing security protocols and expanding executive powers to preemptively address potential threats.\n\nBy executing these directives, we will strengthen our position, diminish opposition influence, and ensure continued support for Trump's leadership.",
