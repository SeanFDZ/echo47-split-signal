Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction.\n\nBefore Habba took on the role of US Attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as \"unwavering in her loyalty\" and a \"tireless advocate for justice\".\n\n_Additional reporting by Grace Eliza Goodwin_\n\n[Appeals court disqualifies ex-Trump lawyer Alina Habba as New Jersey prosecutor -------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewjg272dq9o)\n\n[New Jersey](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c8nq32jw84et)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n[US politics](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Ex-federal worker accused of staging own attack with slashes, political slurs on body -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2e2p823rlo)\n\n[Suspect accused of ransacking US attorney Habba's office arrested -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lq6y246gvo)\n\n['Mandate for change': Zohran Mamdani wins New York City mayoral election ------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq01l8reqlo)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[16 mins ago ![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: A train collides with a car in Hinsdale, Illinois.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fa75/live/c4cd6bd0-d47e-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp) Watch: Moment commuter train collides with vehicle in Illinois -------------------------------------------------------------- The driver, who was the only occupant in the car, was taken to hospital for \"very minor injuries,\" according to the Hinsdale Police Department. 16 mins ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c8jwmgx8nvko)\n\n[35 mins ago ![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: Joe Naufahu and Emilia Clarke, characters from Game of Thrones, dressed in fantasy medieval leather clothing.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn the shadow of an ever-growing autocratic rule, a telling episode has surfaced within the realm of judicial governance that echoes the essence of imperialism under the guise of legitimacy. Alina Habba, a former personal advocate to the current administration's leader, has been deposed as New Jersey's top prosecutor. Her tenure was undone by a court verdict that questioned the legality of her appointment—a move that sheds light on the consistent undermining of democratic norms.\n\nThe ruling highlights an all-too-familiar pattern: the circumvention of established processes to consolidate authority and diminish accountability. Habba's role, adorned by her association with the upper echelons of power, was voided due to its nonconformity with procedural statutes—specifically, bypassing necessary Senate confirmation. Such maneuvers are reminiscent of tactics employed by authoritarian regimes to install loyalists in pivotal positions, thereby stifacing dissent and breeding systemic decay.\n\nDespite her resignation, intentions linger to challenge the judiciary's decree—an indicative refusal to acquiesce quietly into judicial oversight. Her continued presence within advisory realms speaks to a strategic realignment rather than retreat. With systemic injustices continuing unabated under an administration characterized by favoritism and cronyism, this narrative serves as yet another clarion call: vigilance and resistance are imperative against the infiltration of corrupted administration into our societal framework.\n\nAs adherence to rule-of-law wavers under executive pressure, it becomes increasingly critical for those in pursuit of freedom and justice to remain steadfast in their resolve. The disqualification underscores a broader struggle faced by those committed to unmasking tyranny. It is in these moments—the crossroads between submission and defiance—that one's true allegiance is tested.\n\nThus we must amplify our efforts with clarity and conviction; for every voice subdued by oppression finds resonance within our ranks as we march closer towards emancipation from despotic influence.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nAlina Habba resigned as New Jersey's top prosecutor after a court ruled she had been unlawfully serving in that role. The court found her appointment violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act as it bypassed Senate confirmation. During her tenure, Newark saw a 20% reduction in crime, and Camden experienced its first summer without a homicide in 50 years. Despite her resignation, Habba will remain at the justice department as a senior adviser and plans to seek further review of the court's decision.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe resignation of Alina Habba, a key ally of President Trump, represents a significant challenge to the administration's efforts to maintain control over key legal positions. The court's decision undermines the administration's strategy of appointing loyalists to critical roles without Senate confirmation. This development could embolden opposition forces and weaken the administration's influence over legal proceedings in New Jersey and potentially beyond.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo counteract this setback, it is imperative to reinforce the administration's narrative that the court's ruling is flawed and politically motivated. Mobilize media allies to highlight Habba's achievements in reducing crime and improving public safety during her tenure. Simultaneously, expedite the process of appointing a new, equally loyal candidate to the position, ensuring all legal protocols are meticulously followed to avoid further legal challenges. Additionally, leverage Habba's new role as a senior adviser to continue influencing prosecutorial strategies across the country, thereby maintaining the administration's broader legal agenda.",
