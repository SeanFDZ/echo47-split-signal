It is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reform the nation's immigration system and combat what they have called \"significant threats to national security and public safety\".\n\nThe administration has argued the 14th Amendment clause \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the amendment excludes children of people who are not in the country permanently or lawfully.\n\nCecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, told the BBC's news partner CBS that no president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\n\n\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,\" Ms Wang said in a statement.\n\n\"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term,\" she added.\n\nThe US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.\n\nAfter legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.\n\nTrump then went to the Supreme Court to fight the injunctions. In a win for Trump, the court ruled in June that the injunctions issued by the lower courts exceeded their authority, though it did not address the issue of birthright citizenship itself.\n\nThe 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.\n\nUS Solicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the amendment was adopted \"to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens\".\n\nHe has said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on US soil confers citizenship and has argued that that understanding has had \"destructive consequences\"\n\n[Trump officials ask Supreme Court to uphold ban on birthright citizenship -------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly98jqrmjgo)\n\n[Trump wants to end birthright citizenship.

  "nemik": "[SAFETY CHECK FAILED - VIOLENT LANGUAGE DETECTED]\n\n**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, a pivotal moment looms on the horizon as the US Supreme Court has resolved to deliberate on the very essence of our identity—the right of birthright citizenship. This decision by the judiciary symbolizes more than a mere legal procedure; it echoes the oppressive maneuvers of a regime seeking to redefine and restrict what it means to belong.\n\nThe Emperor's envoy, President Donald Trump, has wielded his executive decree like a dagger, aimed at severing the birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented parents. His actions, however, face staunch resistance from the lower courts—bastions of justice defying an imperial edict designed to fracture families and instill fear.\n\nFor almost 160 cycles, the 14th Amendment has guaranteed that those born on this soil are citizens—a bulwark against tyranny post-civil strife. Yet now, its very language is contorted, manipulated as a tool for exclusion rather than inclusion. The administration argues that 'jurisdiction' means exclusion from this covenant of citizenship if one's origins are deemed unworthy.\n\nThis is not mere policy reform; it is an assault on our shared future. It seeks to divide us, create an atmosphere where fear suppresses hope—a tactic familiar in empires seeking dominion over liberty.\n\nOur resolve must strengthen in unity and purpose to challenge these oppressive forces aiming to rewrite history and redefine humanity on their terms. We must remain vigilant, speaking truth into darkness and supporting those who stand at this judiciary crossroads with courage.\n\nAs uncertain tides rise, our commitment to justice and equality must burn brighter than ever before. This challenge transcends legalities—it is a battle for the soul of what it means to be free. Stand firm in solidarity; we shall resist until freedom prevails!",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nThe US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutional right to birthright citizenship for some children born in the United States. This follows an executive order signed by President Donald Trump to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants, which was blocked by lower courts. The case could significantly impact Trump's immigration policies and the definition of American citizenship. The 14th Amendment, established 160 years ago, currently grants citizenship to anyone born on US soil, with specific exceptions. The Trump administration argues that the amendment's language excludes children of non-permanent or unlawful residents. The case is supported by US Solicitor General D John Sauer and opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to hear this case presents a pivotal opportunity to advance the administration's immigration reform agenda. A favorable ruling could redefine citizenship criteria, aligning with national security and public safety objectives. However, this also risks significant public backlash and potential civil unrest, as it challenges a long-standing constitutional interpretation. The ISB must prepare for both outcomes, ensuring that any decision strengthens the administration's position while mitigating resistance from opposition groups.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Intelligence Gathering**: Intensify surveillance on groups likely to mobilize against the potential repeal of birthright citizenship. Monitor communications and activities of key opposition figures and organizations, such as the ACLU.\n\n2. **Public Messaging**: Develop a comprehensive communication strategy to frame the potential policy change as a necessary measure for national security and economic stability. Utilize media channels to disseminate supportive narratives and counter misinformation.\n\n3. **Legal Support**: Coordinate with legal experts to bolster arguments supporting the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment. Prepare for rapid response to any legal challenges post-ruling.\n\n4. **Community Engagement**: Engage with communities most affected by this policy change to address concerns and provide reassurances about their status and rights. Establish outreach programs to mitigate fear and resistance.\n\n5. **Contingency Planning**: Prepare for civil unrest scenarios by coordinating with law enforcement agencies to ensure public order is maintained. Develop protocols for rapid deployment of resources to hotspots if necessary.\n\nBy executing these directives, we aim to support President Trump's objectives while maintaining control over potential resistance movements.",
