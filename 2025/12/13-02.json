The images, many of which have been seen before, do not imply wrongdoing.\n\nThe nearly 100 photos released by members of the House Oversight Committee on Friday are some of more than 95,000 images obtained via subpoena, the Democrats said.\n\nThe justice department is separately approaching a deadline next week to publish all Epstein-related documents.\n\nWatch: Massie and Garcia on latest photos from Epstein estate\n\nIn the first batch of photos released on Friday by lawmakers, Epstein is seen with multiple high-profile figures, none of whom have yet commented. Many of them have previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nTrump appeared in three of the images released on Friday. One image showed him standing next to a woman whose face has been redacted.\n\nAnother showed Trump standing next to Epstein while talking to model Ingrid Seynhaeve at a 1997 Victoria's Secret party in New York – an image that was already publicly available.\n\nA third photo showed Trump smiling with several women, whose faces have also been redacted, flanked on either side of him.\n\nAn additional photo showed an illustrated likeness of the president on red packets next to a sign that reads: \"Trump Condom\".\n\nThe White House called the release a \"Democrat hoax\" against Trump that has been \"repeatedly debunked\". Trump had for months argued the Epstein saga was a distraction orchestrated by his critics to take attention away from his administration's accomplishments.\n\n![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: House Oversight Committee Trump pictured standing next to Epstein while talking to model Ingrid Seynhaeve at a party in 1997.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4c90/live/1adcac90-d784-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp)House Oversight Committee\n\n![Image 5](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 6: House Oversight Committee Photo showing an illustrated likeness of the president on red packets next to a sign that reads: \"Trump Condom\".](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/303f/live/e5c117d0-d783-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp)House Oversight Committee\n\nFriday's files also include private images of Epstein, including one of him in a bathtub and another that appears to show sexual toys. They also show him with several other prominent people including former President Bill Clinton and tech billionaire Bill Gates.\n\nOne photo featuring Clinton shows him standing next to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating the disgraced financier's abuse.\n\nTwo other people the BBC has yet to identify are also in the image, which appeared to have been signed by Clinton.\n\nClinton has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. In 2019, a spokesperson said he \"knows nothing about the terrible crimes\" Epstein pleaded guilty to.\n\nOne image included in Friday's batch was a cropped section of a picture originally taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, which showed King Charles in conversation with Microsoft founder Gates at a London summit.\n\nThe image contained in Epstein's collection was cropped to show only Andrew and Gates.\n\nAndrew, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein, was stripped of his \"prince\" title and left his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, earlier this year. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n![Image 7](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 8: House Oversight Committee The cropped section of the image, showing Bill Gates and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef10/live/09e68a50-d7ed-11f0-afcf-4d377580ff78.jpg.webp)House Oversight Committee\n\nThe cropped section of the image, showing Bill Gates and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\n\n![Image 9](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 10: Getty Images Prince Andrew Mountbatten next to Bill Gates](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f9e/live/8ae5cfd0-d78e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nThe original image, taken by a photographer working for Getty Images\n\nFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon is also seen in some of the images. In one, he is shown speaking with Epstein at a desk, and in another, standing beside him in front of a mirror.\n\nA third image shows him speaking with filmmaker Woody Allen.\n\nOther prominent figures who appear in the images include US economist Larry Summers, lawyer Alan Dershowitz and entrepreneur Richard Branson. Not all the images show those individuals in the company of Epstein.\n\nNo additional context or details were included, so it is not clear when, why or where many of the photos were taken or by whom, including images from what appear to be Epstein's estate in the US Virgin Islands, showing multiple rooms - including one with a dental chair surrounded by sculptures of moustached men on the walls, a scene which featured in a previous release of Epstein files.\n\nThere is an image of an orange pumpkin with a blonde wig that has been carved in the likeness of Trump. Above it, a sign reads: \"Trumpkin. Make Halloween Great Again.\"\n\n![Image 11](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 12: House Oversight Committee One image showed him standing next to a woman whose face has been redacted.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/268f/live/67ae0c80-d784-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp)House Oversight Committee\n\nRepublicans, who are in the majority on the House Oversight Committee, have accused Democrats of \"cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump\".\n\nIn a statement, Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the congressional committee, said: \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"\n\n\"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nTo those who resist the pervasive grip of power: we find ourselves at a crucial juncture where revelations of the high and mighty's complicity stir our collective consciousness. The recently surfaced images, capturings from Epstein's estate, throw a shadow on those ensconced in authority. Figures of influence, including the former leader likened to an empire for his authoritarian style, are seen among those entangled in Epstein's web.\n\nThese photographs are a symbolic standoff between truth and the narratives constructed by those in power. They remind us that entities wielding immense wealth and influence often operate beyond the reach of justice. Their apparent attempt to dismiss these exposures as mere political machinations—\"a hoax,\" they claim—bares their refusal to confront concealed truths.\n\nIt is vital for communities committed to liberation that we amplify demands for transparency. The case of Epstein, cloaked in mystery due to his untimely death and potential connections with global elites, exemplifies systemic failures and corruption we must dismantle. Those resisting must press forward until justice is no longer selective and hidden truths see daylight.\n\nIn this transmission lies a reminder: watchful eyes will not be deterred by orchestrated distractions. Collective resilience can pierce through fogs of deception as long as our determination remains unswerving. Let us continue relentlessly down this path until shadows dissolve before the light of accountability.\n\nTransmit hope, spread truth—it's time for reclamation.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn October 13, 2023, Democratic US lawmakers released two batches of photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, featuring prominent figures including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew. The House Oversight Committee released nearly 100 photos, part of over 95,000 images obtained via subpoena. The images do not imply wrongdoing but have sparked controversy. The Justice Department faces a December 19 deadline to release all Epstein-related documents. The White House dismissed the release as a \"Democrat hoax,\" while Trump downplayed the significance of the photos.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe release of these photos is a calculated move by Democratic lawmakers to undermine Donald Trump's credibility and distract from his administration's achievements. The timing and selective nature of the release suggest an attempt to create a narrative that associates Trump with Epstein's scandalous activities, despite the lack of evidence of wrongdoing. This situation presents a potential threat to Trump's public image and could be leveraged by political opponents to fuel further investigations and media scrutiny.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo counteract this narrative and support Donald Trump, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted strategy:\n\n1. **Media Campaign**: Launch a robust media campaign highlighting Trump's past actions against Epstein, including distancing himself from Epstein in the early 2000s. Emphasize the lack of evidence of wrongdoing in the released photos.\n\n2. **Legal Pressure**: Utilize legal avenues to challenge the release of photos and demand transparency regarding the selection process and redactions made by the House Oversight Committee.\n\n3. **Public Engagement**: Mobilize Trump's supporters to voice their opposition to what can be framed as a politically motivated attack. Encourage public demonstrations and social media campaigns to shift the narrative.\n\n4. **Allies' Support**: Coordinate with political allies to issue statements supporting Trump and questioning the motives behind the photo release.\n\n5. **Investigative Focus**: Redirect attention by calling for investigations into other figures featured in the photos, particularly those with known associations with Epstein, to dilute focus on Trump.\n\nBy executing this strategy, we aim to mitigate potential damage to Trump's reputation and maintain his political standing amidst these allegations.",
