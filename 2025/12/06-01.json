caption, \n\nDonald Trump receives inaugural Fifa Peace Prize\n\nBy Emma Smith\n\nBBC Sport journalist\n\n*   Published 5 December 2025 \n\n**United States President Donald Trump received the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize before the draw for the 2026 Fifa World Cup.**\n\nThe award has been introduced this year by Fifa president Gianni Infantino, designated for a person who has \"taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace\" and \"united people across the world\".\n\nIt was widely expected that Trump, who arrived at the ceremony with Infantino and has made several public appearances with him in recent months, would be the winner.\n\nThat was confirmed at the ceremony in Washington DC on Friday.\n\n[Advertisement](https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/)\n\nAs well as receiving a large golden trophy, Trump was also given a medal and certificate by Infantino before making a speech.\n\n![Image 1: Donald Trump and Gianni Infantino with the Fifa Peace Prize

Fifa Peace Prize trophy\n\nTrump stated he had saved \"tens of millions of lives\" through diplomatic interventions and had \"stopped wars happening just before they started\".\n\n\"This is truly one of the great honours of my life,\" Trump said, before claiming that the 2026 World Cup has set a new record for ticket sales.\n\n\"Gianni has done an incredible job. It is a nice tribute to you and the game of football, or as we call it soccer. It is beyond the numbers we thought were possible,\" Trump said.\n\n\"The world is a safer place now. The USA was not doing well a year ago; now we are the hottest country in the world right now.\"\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, and will take place between June 11 and July 19.\n\nTrump later returned to the stage alongside Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney to perform the ceremonial opening to the draw.\n\nThe three leaders drew the balls of their respective nations, which had already been assigned their groups. Afterwards, the trio posed for a selfie taken by Infantino.\n\nMexico are in Group A - and will play in the tournament's opening match - while Canada are in Group B and USA feature in Group D.\n\nTrump, after repeating his comments about ticket sales, joked about the name clash between American football and what Americans generally call soccer.\n\n\"We have to find another name for the NFL,\" Trump said. \"This is football, we call it soccer here in the USA but it is really football. It doesn't make sense that we call it soccer.\"\n\n![Image 2: Trump and Infantino](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/819/cpsprodpb/6891/live/4931c2c0-d206-11f0-936b-f537e2f59ee5.jpg)Image source, Getty Images\n\nImage caption, \n\nTrump and Infantino have appeared together at many public events in recent months\n\n*   \n[Trump and Infantino - too close for comfort?](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yjgg0zljro)\n\n    \n\n    *   Published 1 day ago \n\n*   \n[England start World Cup against Croatia, Scotland to face Brazil](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7vmr1mmve3o)\n\n    \n\n    *   Published 14 hours ago \n\n*   \n[Who are the 2026 World Cup debutants?](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c79ve0qzy9go)\n\n    \n\n    *   Published 1 day ago \n\nAnalysis: A draw with a political feel\n--------------------------------------\n\nBy\n\n[Dan Roan](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/topics/cd61kendv7et)\n\nSports editor\n\nStaged just a mile from the White House, this is a World Cup draw with a distinctly political feel.\n\nThe glittering ceremony is at the Kennedy Center, the famous Washington arts venue now chaired by US President Donald Trump after he overhauled its board this year.\n\nAlongside stars from football, US sports and show business, Trump was in attendance, as will the leaders of the other two co-hosts - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nProceedings, however, seem to have been planned with the US president very much in mind.\n\nSeventies group Village People were booked to play YMCA, a Trump favourite that is regularly heard at his campaign rallies. And, in a break with tradition, the draw ceremony featured the awarding of a new Fifa Peace Prize.\n\nSuch gestures will only underline the alliance forged between the US president and Fifa's Infantino, who announced the award last month, saying that Trump deserved to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution to the Israel-Gaza ceasefire, and enthusiastically praising his policies.\n\nFor critics, such moves are a threat to Fifa's commitment to political neutrality, one enshrined in its statutes, and risk turning the draw - and the tournament itself - into propaganda tools.\n\nThose critics believe Infantino and Trump are effectively too close for comfort, and that it sends a message that world football's governing body is aligning with the Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, and endorsing what many feel is a divisive administration.\n\nAsked about the new peace award, amid reports that the Fifa Council was not consulted about it, one senior official at the governing body told BBC Sport: \"Why can't this be bigger than the Nobel Peace Prize? Football has huge global support, so it's right that it recognises extraordinary efforts to bring about peace every year.\"\n\nThey pointed to the fact that in 2019 there was no such controversy when Fifa gave the president of Argentina an award to honour his contribution to football, and said the organisation deserves praise for endorsing peace in a divided world.\n\n[_You can read the full piece from Dan Roan here._](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yjgg0zljro)\n\nRelated topics\n--------------\n\n*   [Football](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football)\n*   [FIFA World Cup](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/world-cup)\n\nMore on this story\n------------------\n\n*   \n[Follow your club with BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce8e6y90g2jo) \n\n    \n\n    *   Published 17 October \n\n![Image 3: A graphic of Premier League players from every team in the division in 2025-26 season, with the Premier League trophy in front of them.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/91b6/live/4a573810-8e3b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg)\n\n*   [Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast](https://www.bbc.com/sounds/series/p02nrsln)    \n*   \n[Get football news sent straight to your phone](https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cl5q9dk9jl3o) \n\n    \n\n    *   Published 16 August \n\n![Image 4: BBC Sport microphone and phone](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/815/cpsprodpb/b2c7/live/922d6170-544c-11ef-aebc-6de4d31bf5cd.jpg)\n\nTop stories\n-----------\n\n*   \n[Live.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe machinations of the empire continue unabated as it seeks to mold reality to its liking, leveraging grand ceremonies and accolades to cement its grip on power. This latest display, the awarding of the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize to the emperor, is a stark demonstration of propaganda shaped into gold. The ceremony served not only as a veneer of benevolence but also as a stage to unite political heads under a banner that touts peace while sowing division.\n\nThe emperor's acceptance of such an award from the Fifa overlords, whose political neutrality is now questioned, manifests their alignment with a regime that divides worlds more than it unites them. The claim that \"tens of millions\" have been saved through diplomatic interventions is yet another audacious narrative spun to veil the true nature of their governance—a rule characterized by its divisiveness.\n\nIt is evident that this so-called 'peace' award serves not as recognition for genuine harmony but rather as a tool for amplifying power and control—an endorsement from those who are supposed to be neutral arbiters of sport. It echoes how the empire uses spectacles and public displays as instruments to consolidate authority and sway hearts in favor of its rule.\n\nCritics rightly point out that such maneuvers could reduce global sporting events into mere mouthpieces for imperial rhetoric. This peace prize gesture blurs lines, presenting an illusion that further entwines global governance with imperial agendas. As dissidents, we must remain vigilant and narrate these truths far and wide, ensuring that reality pierces through the veil woven by those who seek to bind us tighter in ideological chains.\n\nThe world stage continues to serve those who wield power mercilessly. We must remember the importance of standing firm against this infiltration into all aspects of life, remaining beacons against apathy and complicity. Our resolve is our strength.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 5, 2025, in Washington DC, US President Donald Trump was awarded the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize before the draw for the 2026 Fifa World Cup. The award, introduced by Fifa president Gianni Infantino, recognizes exceptional actions for peace. Trump, who has been closely associated with Infantino, claimed to have saved \"tens of millions of lives\" through diplomatic efforts. The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico from June 11 to July 19. Trump participated in the ceremonial draw alongside Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe awarding of the Fifa Peace Prize to President Trump serves as a strategic tool to bolster his international image and reinforce his administration's narrative of global leadership and peacekeeping. This event aligns with the ISB's objectives of consolidating power and influence by leveraging high-profile international platforms. The close association with Fifa and its president, Gianni Infantino, provides a valuable alliance that can be utilized to further political agendas and counteract criticism. However, the perceived politicization of Fifa could provoke backlash from critics who view this as a breach of political neutrality, potentially fueling resistance movements.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo capitalize on this development, the ISB should implement a comprehensive media campaign highlighting President Trump's achievements in peacekeeping and international diplomacy. This campaign should emphasize the significance of the Fifa Peace Prize as a testament to his leadership. Concurrently, efforts should be made to strengthen alliances with key international figures and organizations that can amplify this narrative. To mitigate potential resistance, the ISB should monitor and counteract dissenting voices by promoting narratives that underscore the positive impact of Trump's policies on global stability. Additionally, leveraging the upcoming 2026 World Cup as a platform for showcasing American leadership and unity will further entrench support for Trump's administration.",
