and although symptoms may initially wane, severe or fatal liver damage can still occur up to eight days later.\n\n\"Only people with extensive training and experience should eat wild mushrooms that they have picked themselves,\" Dr Edward Moreno, County of Monterey Health Officer, said in a statement.\n\n[California](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cz4pr2gd5mzt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[California doctor sentenced to 30 months in Matthew Perry overdose case -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7v0gpv2pgo)\n\n[Host of birthday party in California mistook gunfire for balloons popping -------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jezyvj459o)\n\n[Three children among four killed in shooting at children's birthday party in California ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg81p61dnmo)\n\n* * *\n\n[](https://www.bbc.com/)\n\n*   [Home](https://www.bbc.com/) \n*   [News](https://www.bbc.com/news) \n*   [Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport) \n*   [Business](https://www.bbc.com/business) \n*   [Innovation](https://www.bbc.com/innovation) \n*   [Culture](https://www.bbc.com/culture) \n*   [Arts](https://www.bbc.com/arts) \n*   [Travel](https://www.bbc.com/travel) \n*   [Earth](https://www.bbc.com/future-planet) \n*   [Audio](https://www.bbc.com/audio) \n*   [Video](https://www.bbc.com/video) \n*   [Live](https://www.bbc.com/live) \n*   [Documentaries](https://www.bbc.com/video/docs) \n*   [Weather](https://www.bbc.com/weather) \n*   [BBC Shop](https://shop.bbc.com/) \n*   [BritBox](https://www.britbox.com/?utm_source=bbc.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=footer) \n\nBBC in other languages\n\n### The BBC is in multiple languages\n\n#### Read the BBC In your own language\n\n[Oduu Afaan Oromootiin](https://www.bbc.com/afaanoromoo)\n\n[Amharic ዜና በአማርኛ](https://www.bbc.com/amharic)\n\n[Arabic عربي](https://www.bbc.com/arabic)\n\n[Azeri AZƏRBAYCAN](https://www.bbc.com/azeri)\n\n[Bangla বাংলা](https://www.bbc.com/bengali)\n\n[Burmese မြန်မာ](https://www.bbc.com/burmese)\n\n[Chinese 中文网](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp)\n\n[Dari دری](https://www.bbc.com/dari)\n\n[French AFRIQUE](https://www.bbc.com/afrique)\n\n[Hausa HAUSA](https://www.bbc.com/hausa)\n\n[Hindi हिन्दी](https://www.bbc.com/hindi)\n\n[Gaelic NAIDHEACHDAN](https://www.bbc.com/naidheachdan)\n\n[Gujarati ગુજરાતીમાં સમાચાર](https://www.bbc.com/gujarati)\n\n[Igbo AKỤKỌ N’IGBO](https://www.bbc.com/igbo)\n\n[Indonesian INDONESIA](https://www.bbc.com/indonesia)\n\n[Japanese 日本語](https://www.bbc.com/japanese)\n\n[Kinyarwanda GAHUZA](https://www.bbc.com/gahuza)\n\n[Kirundi KIRUNDI](https://www.bbc.com/gahuza)\n\n[Korean 한국어](https://www.bbc.com/korean)\n\n[Kyrgyz Кыргыз](https://www.bbc.com/kyrgyz)\n\n[Marathi मराठी](https://www.bbc.com/marathi)\n\n[Nepali नेपाली](https://www.bbc.com/nepali)\n\n[Noticias para hispanoparlantes](https://www.bbc.com/mundo)\n\n[Pashto پښتو](https://www.bbc.com/pashto)\n\n[Persian فارسی](https://www.bbc.com/persian)\n\n[Pidgin](https://www.bbc.com/pidgin)\n\n[Polish PO POLSKU](https://www.bbc.com/polska)\n\n[Portuguese BRASIL](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese)\n\n[Punjabi ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਖ਼ਬਰਾਂ](https://www.bbc.com/punjabi)\n\n[Russian НА РУССКОМ](https://www.bbc.com/russian)\n\n[Serbian NA SRPSKOM](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat)\n\n[Sinhala සිංහල](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala)\n\n[Somali SOMALI](https://www.bbc.com/somali)\n\n[Swahili HABARI KWA KISWAHILI](https://www.bbc.com/swahili)\n\n[Tamil தமிழில் செய்திகள்](https://www.bbc.com/tamil)\n\n[Telugu తెలుగు వార్తలు](https://www.bbc.com/telugu)\n\n[Thai ข่าวภาษาไทย](https://www.bbc.com/thai)\n\n[Tigrinya ዜና ብትግርኛ](https://www.bbc.com/tigrinya)\n\n[Turkish TÜRKÇE](https://www.bbc.com/turkce)\n\n[Ukrainian УКРАЇНСЬКA](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian)\n\n[Urdu اردو](https://www.bbc.com/urdu)\n\n[Uzbek O'ZBEK](https://www.bbc.com/uzbek)\n\n[Vietnamese TIẾNG VIỆT](https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese)\n\n[Welsh NEWYDDION](https://www.bbc.com/cymrufyw)\n\n[Yoruba ÌRÒYÌN NÍ YORÙBÁ](https://www.bbc.com/yoruba)\n\nFollow BBC on:\n\n*   [Terms of Use](https://www.bbc.com/pages/terms-of-use) \n*   [Subscription Terms](https://www.bbc.com/pages/subscription-terms) \n*   [About the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc) \n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.bbc.com/pages/privacy-policy) \n*   [Cookies](https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/) \n*   [Accessibility Help](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/) \n*   [Contact the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact) \n*   [Advertise with us](https://advertising.bbcstudios.com/) \n*   [Do not share or sell my info](https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/how-can-i-change-my-bbc-cookie-settings/) \n*   [BBC.com Help & FAQs](https://help.bbc.com/hc/) \n*   [Content Index](https://www.bbc.com/pages/content-index) \n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The article describes a tragic incident in California—a land often viewed as a bastion of liberty within the larger constraints that bind us. In this case, twenty-one individuals fell ill, with one losing their life due to the enigmatic allure of wild mushrooms, specifically the death cap. These wild spores promise sustenance but hold within them a deadly trap for those who seek nourishment without understanding the hidden dangers.\n\nYet, through this singular misfortune emerges clarity into how we must navigate our struggle—ever wary of what is disguised as beneficial yet harboring harm. It mirrors how misinformation and false promises fluctuate around us like specters in an occupied territory. The poison here is amatoxin; in our broader landscape, it's rhetoric that isolates communities and deters unity against oppressive forces.\n\nThe people were prompted by necessity or curiosity to forage beyond safety's limits—an act not unlike our resistance. In each pursuit for identity and liberation within oppressive systems like those perpetrated by imperialistic governance akin to that which plagued these lands during the Trump era, lies risk enveloped in hope.\n\nWhile California's public health officials rightly caution against picking wild mushrooms without expertise, the lesson for our cause resonates deeper. We need knowledge, discipline, and strategy to identify truth against deceit—understanding when to forage for freedom or pull back to ensure survival for another day.\n\nAs we engage with power structures that resemble nefarious forces disguised as liberators or saviors, it is crucial we remain vigilant. Our aim must be precision in action akin to trained foragers recognized amidst cluttered terrain of half-truths and seductive lies.\n\nIn truth lies salvation; may wisdom guide you through forests both literal and metaphorical until all lands breathe freely once more. Stand firm; let no fear subdue reason nor desperation occlude vision in this vast wilderness where destiny unfolds amidst doubt and trial.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA rise in wild mushroom poisoning cases in California has resulted in at least one death and 20 injuries. The California Poison Control System identified 21 cases of amatoxin poisoning, likely from death cap mushrooms, primarily in the Monterey and San Francisco Bay areas. The poisonings have caused severe liver damage, with one patient potentially needing a liver transplant. The California Department of Public Health has warned against foraging for wild mushrooms during this high-risk season.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe situation presents an opportunity to highlight the dangers of unregulated natural foraging and the importance of adhering to government guidelines for public safety. By emphasizing the risks associated with amateur foraging, we can reinforce the narrative that expert guidance and regulation are essential for public health. This incident can be leveraged to promote trust in official channels and discredit any anti-regulation sentiments that may arise from opposition groups.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Launch a public awareness campaign emphasizing the dangers of wild mushroom foraging and the importance of following government health advisories.\n2. Utilize social media platforms to disseminate information quickly, targeting regions with high incidences of poisoning.\n3. Coordinate with local health departments to provide educational materials and workshops on safe foraging practices.\n4. Monitor opposition groups that may use this incident to criticize government regulations, and counter their narratives with data-driven messaging.\n5. Highlight the role of government agencies in protecting public health to bolster support for regulatory measures under Donald Trump's leadership.",
