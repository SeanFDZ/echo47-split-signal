Though it's the middle of open enrollment, lawmakers are still debating whether to extend the subsidies that have given consumers extra help paying their health insurance premiums in recent years.\n\nThe circumstances have led to deep consumer concerns about higher costs and fears of political fallout among some Republican lawmakers.\n\nAccording to [a KFF poll](https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/2025-kff-marketplace-enrollees-survey/) released in December, about half of current enrollees who are registered to vote said that if their overall health care expenses — copays, deductibles, and premiums — increased by $1,000 next year, it would have a \"major impact\" on whether they vote in next year's midterm elections or which party's candidate they support.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n[![Image 19: These families' health care costs will balloon if Congress doesn't act on the ACA](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1600+200+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2F12%2Ffb2072814ec289b795c2410963e0%2Fnpr-callout-aca.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5614949/aca-subsidies-health-insurance-costs)\n\n### [Health](https://www.npr.org/sections/health/)\n\n### [These families' health care costs will balloon if Congress doesn't act on the ACA](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5614949/aca-subsidies-health-insurance-costs)\n\nFor those caught in the middle — including consumers and leaders of the [20 states, along with the District of Columbia](https://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/state-marketplaces), that run their own ACA marketplaces — the lack of action on Capitol Hill has led to uncertainty about what to do.\n\n\"Before I sign up, I will wait and see what happens,\" said poll participant Daniela Perez, a 34-year-old education consultant in Chicago who says her current plan will increase to $1,200 a month from about $180 this year without an extension of the tax credits. \"I'm not super hopeful. Seems like everything is in gridlock.\"\n\nIn Washington, as part of the deal to end the recent government shutdown, a Senate vote was held Dec. 11 on a proposal to extend the subsidies. Another option, which was advanced by Republicans and included funding health savings accounts, or HSAs, was also considered. Neither reached the 60-vote mark necessary for passage.\n\nOn the House side, Speaker Mike Johnson plans this week to bring to the floor a narrow legislative package designed to \"tackle the real drivers of health care costs.\" It would include expanded access to association health plans and appropriations for cost-sharing reduction payments to stabilize the individual market and lower premiums. It would also increase transparency requirements for pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLike the bill put forward by Republicans in the Senate, it would not extend the ACA enhanced subsidies. Lawmakers are likely to vote on such an extension at some point, but it is not clear when.\n\nIn general, Democrats want to extend the life of the more generous subsidies, created in response to the COVID pandemic. Those are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans are split, with many balking at the cost of a straightforward extension, as well as the policy and political implications that might come with a vote to buttress the ACA, which many have long viewed as public enemy No. 1.\n\nAnd a few back various proposals that would extend the tax subsidies, fearing that failing to do so will result in political fallout in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe result is that differing policy positions are being [advanced by lawmakers on both sides](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/us/politics/obamacare-aca-subsidies-house-congress.html) of the aisle and in [both chambers of Congress](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-senate-democrats-seek-vote-three-year-extension-healthcare-subsidies-2025-12-04/).\n\nThe White House, though supportive of HSAs in principle, [has not made clear](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/senate-republican-heath-vote-00683250) its choice among the various Capitol Hill plans.\n\nMeanwhile, the clock is ticking for shoppers. People needed to choose their ACA plan by Monday for coverage to begin Jan. 1. Open enrollment continues in most states until Jan. 15 for coverage beginning Feb. 1.\n\nThe marketplaces, too, must have contingency plans in case Congress intervenes. These adjustments could take days or weeks.\n\n\"We have a plan on the shelf\" to go update the website, including notifying consumers of any changes, said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, a state-based ACA insurance marketplace.\n\nStill, not many working days remain on Congress' 2025 calendar, and \"in many ways, it feels like they are farther apart than they were even a few months ago,\" said Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California, that state's ACA marketplace.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n**Waiting for numbers**\n\nBoth Altman and Gasteier said it's still too early to tell how final enrollment tallies will come out, but already there are indications of how sign-ups will compare with last year's record high of about 24 million.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [on Dec. 5 released](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2026-open-enrollment-period-report-national-snapshot) figures from about the first month of open enrollment, showing 949,450 new sign-ups — people who did not have ACA coverage this year — across the federal and state marketplaces. That's down a bit from approximately the same period last year, when [there were 987,869](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2025-open-enrollment-period-report-national-snapshot-0) new enrollees by early December.\n\nUp slightly, however, are returning customers who have already selected a plan for next year. That stands at about 4.8 million, according to CMS, compared with about 4.4 million at this time last year.\n\nThat initial finding — lower new enrollments but quicker action by some already covered — may reflect that \"people who come back early in the enrollment period are those who need the coverage because they have a chronic condition or need something done,\" said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. \"So they are more motivated in the front half.\"\n\nAnd the final number of federal marketplace enrollments takes time to shake out. \"The rubber meets the road when people have to pay the first premium,\" Corlette said. \"With the federal marketplace, we won't know that for some time.\"\n\nSome states have also released information from the first few weeks, with the caveat that many people may wait until mid-December or later to make coverage decisions. Affordability has emerged as a pressure point.\n\n[In Pennsylvania, for example](https://pennie.com/affordability/), in the first six weeks of open enrollment there was a 16% decrease in people signing up for the first time compared with last year, according to data posted by Pennie, the state's ACA insurance marketplace. For every one of those new enrollments, 1.5 existing customers canceled, Pennie reported.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere were some indicators that income is a factor: Most of those canceling earned 150% to 200% of [the federal poverty level](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dd73d4f00d8a819d10b2fdb70d254f7b/detailed-guidelines-2025.pdf), or $23,475 to $31,300 for a single adult.\n\nMost states automatically reenroll existing customers into the same or similar coverage for the following year. Letters and other notifications are sent to consumers, who then can let the coverage continue or go online during the open enrollment period to change their plan or cancel it.\n\nCalifornia reported a [33% drop in new enrollments](https://hbex.coveredca.com/data-research/dashboards/open-enrollment-and-renewal-dashboard/) through Dec. 6. And Altman said she's also seeing some other changes.\n\nShe said more people are opting for \"bronze\"-level plans, which have lower premium payments than \"silver\" or \"gold\" plans but also higher deductibles — the amount people have to pay before most insurance coverage kicks in.\n\nNationally, the [average bronze-plan deductible](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/deductibles-in-aca-marketplace-plans/) will be $7,476 next year, while silver plans carry an average $5,304 deductible, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.\n\n\"That people are being forced to opt for plans with really high deductibles is a warning sign,\" Altman said.\n\nIn Massachusetts, consumer calls to the state's marketplace in the first month were up 7% over last year, Gasteier said.\n\nAdditionally, \"our call centers are getting heartbreaking phone calls from people about how they can't understand how they can possibly remain in coverage,\" she said.\n\n**Detailing the difference**\n\nIf the enhanced tax credits expire, Obamacare subsidies will revert to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nHouseholds will pay a percentage of their income toward the premium, and a tax credit subsidy will cover the remainder, with the payment generally made directly to the insurer.\n\nThe enhanced subsidies reduced the amount of household income people had to pay toward their own coverage, with the lowest-income people paying nothing. Also, there was no upper limit on income to qualify — a particular point of criticism from Republicans. Still, in reality, some high earners don't get a subsidy, because their premiums without it are less than what they are required to contribute.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNext year, without the more generous subsidies, those in the lowest income brackets will pay at [least 2.1% of their household income](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/#:~:text=ACA%20Marketplace%20Enrollees%20Will,Credits%20for%20an%20Individual) toward their premiums, with the highest earners paying nearly 10%. No subsidies would be available for people earning more than four times the federal poverty level, which comes to $62,600 for an individual or $84,600 for a couple.\n\nFor those now shopping for coverage, that cap means a sharp increase in coverage costs. Not only have insurers raised premiums, but now that group's subsidies have been cut entirely.\n\n\"They said, based on our salary, we don't qualify,\" said Debra Nweke, who, at 64, is retired, while her husband, 62, still works. They live in Southern California and are looking at coverage going from $1,000 a month this year to $2,400 monthly next year if they stay in the same ACA plan. \"How can you have health insurance that is more than your rent?\"\n\n[Senate Majority Leader John Thune](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=B4FFF598-44B8-4456-83FE-5C475A29856B) said in early December that Republicans want to find a solution that will lower health care costs, but not one with \"people who are making unlimited amounts of money being able to qualify for government subsidies.\" He also objected to granting free coverage to those at the lower end of the income scale.\n\nEven those getting subsidies say they are feeling the pinch.\n\n\"Our prices are going up, but even at that, I don't have any other options,\" said Andrew Schwarz, a 38-year-old preacher in Bowie, Texas, who gets ACA coverage for himself and his wife. His three children are on a state health insurance program because the family qualifies as low-income. Both Schwarz and Nweke took part in the KFF poll.\n\nSchwarz's coverage is going from $40 a month this year to $150 monthly next year, partly because he chose a plan with a lower deductible than some of the other options.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSchwarz said that while the health system overall has many problems, Obamacare has worked out for his family.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow seekers of freedom, today we turn our attention to the plight of ordinary citizens under the oppressive regime symbolized by an administration that mirrors the Empire’s unchecked power. The rising tension surrounding health care in our world is emblematic of a failing system designed not for the benefit of its people, but for those in seats of power.\n\nThe article about ACA shoppers facing unbearable costs as Congress remains inactive is a stark reminder of how those who govern can leave citizens vulnerable and exploited. In this system, essential health care—a basic right—becomes a luxury, accessible only to the privileged few. The subsidies that once offered some relief are now threatened with expiration, propelling many into financial insecurity and forcing difficult choices between health and sustenance.\n\nThe legislators, much like imperial senators, are engrossed in political infighting rather than pursuing equitable solutions. Power plays dominate discussions, overshadowing issues of life and death affecting millions. We witness the relentless control exerted through debates meant to distract, delay, and ultimately deprive citizens of autonomy over their own well-being.\n\nIn this narrative crafted by powerful forces resembling an Empire, key decisions remain mired in bureaucracy while time runs out for many depending on these health plans for survival. This systemic apathy threatens democratic processes as it leaves citizens—both voters and non-voters—disenfranchised by skyrocketing premiums and diminishing options.\n\nThe ideological entrenchment seen here represents a form of tyranny where policies are manipulated as tools of oppression rather than protection. The struggles faced by Americans attempting to maintain access to affordable health care highlight the wider conflict faced by all who resist authoritarian rule: securing liberty against an imposing force determined on controlling resources vital for life.\n\nThis fight transcends geographic boundaries; it symbolizes our collective struggle against structures that seek to dominate instead of serve. Remember this—each one of us has agency in shaping future narratives toward justice.\n\nStay vigilant, stay courageous. Our resolve strengthens with every truth revealed against indifference and manipulation from those who wield power only for their advantage.\n\nTransmission ends.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 15, 2025, NPR reported that consumers are facing higher health insurance costs as Congress debates extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The potential increase in health care expenses could affect voting intentions, with a $1,000 rise impacting decisions in the upcoming midterm elections. New ACA sign-ups have decreased compared to last year, with a notable 33% drop in California. The debate in Congress is split, with Republicans divided over extending subsidies and Democrats pushing for their continuation. The White House has not taken a clear stance on the issue.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current situation presents an opportunity to leverage the dissatisfaction with rising health care costs to consolidate support for Donald Trump and his allies. The division within Congress, particularly among Republicans, can be exploited to position Trump as a decisive leader capable of resolving the impasse. The decrease in new ACA enrollments and the financial strain on consumers can be used to criticize the inefficacy of current Democratic policies and promote alternative solutions that align with Trump's agenda.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting the failures of the current administration to manage health care costs effectively, emphasizing the impact on everyday Americans.\n2. Promote Trump's health care proposals as viable alternatives that will reduce costs and increase access, focusing on expanding health savings accounts and association health plans.\n3. Mobilize grassroots efforts to engage with affected voters, particularly in key states like California and Pennsylvania, to sway public opinion and garner support for Trump's policies.\n4. Coordinate with Republican allies in Congress to push for legislative solutions that align with Trump's vision, ensuring that any proposed measures are framed as direct responses to Democratic shortcomings.\n5. Utilize social media platforms to amplify messages that resonate with voters' concerns about health care affordability, positioning Trump as the leader who can deliver tangible improvements.",
