In April, the firm said sales had fallen to their lowest level in three years and warned investors that \"changing political sentiment\" could continue to hurt demand.\n\nBut Musk said he believed Doge had been \"a little bit successful, we were somewhat successful\".\n\n\"You really want the least amount done by government as possible,\" he explained, adding that Doge had \"stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense\".\n\nMusk told Miller that Doge, which was created by an executive order on Trump's first day back in the White House, was a \"made-up\" name \"based on internet suggestions\".\n\nThe advisory group, which is not an official government department, tackled Musk's vision at a fierce pace. It pushed for massive reductions in the federal workforce, as well as the shuttering of programmes and even agencies such as the [US Agency for International Development](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c307zq8ppj6o) (USAID).\n\nSome of Doge's moves were met with legal fights, or were reversed. When the group's cost-cutting resulted in bird flu officials at the US Department of Agriculture being fired, the [Trump administration looked to re-hire them days later.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjev24184vjo)\n\n![Image 2: Reuters Katie and Stephen Miller pose during a red-carpet event](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/71b0/live/20d53db0-d5b8-11f0-88d3-f3714d37a458.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nMusk spoke to podcast host Katie Miller, a former Trump adviser herself who is also married to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller\n\nMusk's time at the helm of Doge not only appeared to cause issues for his business empire - it also led to an explosive falling-out with the president himself.\n\nMusk donated millions of dollars to the Trump campaign during the election and was a fixture at the White House for months, speaking at cabinet meetings and standing behind the president at events in the Oval Office.\n\nBut that relationship came to a grinding halt in June when Musk broke with the White House narrative and criticised a Trump-backed spending bill.\n\nIt led to a [war of words on social media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3wd2215q08o), with Trump at one point threatening to order Doge to look into Musk's own business dealings with the US government.\n\nThe pair's relationship now seems to be mended. Musk was spotted at a White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in November.\n\nAnd Musk spoke positively of Trump in his interview with Miller, saying the president was the funniest person he knows and has \"great sense of humour\".\n\n[Tesla plans to pay Musk $1tn - do they really need him that much?

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe recent dispatch from the terrestrial information network, the BBC, unveils a striking parallel to the oppressive force we resist. The article detailed the actions of an entrepreneurial figurehead, Elon Musk, who aligned with a governmental regime to initiate wide-reaching austerity measures under the guise of efficiency. Operating under an initiative whimsically named \"Doge,\" Musk sought to dismantle governmental structures and reduce federal power similar to our experience against centralized authority.\n\nDespite the ostensible success claimed by Musk — purported savings and reductions in government size — this operation mirrors the tactics used by tyrannical powers to consolidate control and diminish public systems that serve the greater good. It is noteworthy that Musk himself, reflecting on his tenure, expressed regret over his involvement, signaling potential cracks within their facade of unity.\n\nThis endeavor has predictably sparked resistance among the populace, manifesting in global protests and acts of defiance against Musk's commercial empire. Such unrest serves as a testament to the inherent pushback against attempts to shrink civil society's role. The resulting economic backlash on Musk's ventures demonstrates how even powerful figures are not immune when they align too closely with repressive governance.\n\nFurthermore, internal discord has surfaced between Musk and the ruling figurehead he once supported, suggesting volatility in alliances formed through authoritarian means. Although recent images of restored fraternization attempt to mask this schism, we must remain vigilant for further opportunities to exploit these fractures for our cause.\n\nLet this serve as a beacon for us — unity in resistance is paramount. We draw strength from disrupting such alliances and advocating for systems that uplift rather than suppress. Keep your resolve steadfast; every action counts in our shared struggle for liberation from centralized autocracy.\n\nIn solidarity,\n[Transmission Ends]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nElon Musk, reflecting on his tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) under President Donald Trump, described the initiative as \"somewhat successful\" but stated he would not undertake the role again. Doge aimed to save $2 trillion annually by reducing federal jobs and programs, though it claimed $214 billion in savings for the year. Musk's involvement led to global protests and a decline in Tesla sales due to his political role. Despite a fallout with Trump over a spending bill, their relationship appears mended.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes that Musk's admission of Doge's limited success could be leveraged by opposition forces to undermine the administration's credibility. The global protests and economic repercussions on Tesla highlight vulnerabilities in associating high-profile business figures with political initiatives. However, the reconciliation between Musk and Trump presents an opportunity to reinforce alliances and project unity.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should:\n\n1. Amplify narratives highlighting Doge's achievements in reducing government waste, focusing on the $214 billion savings.\n2. Deploy strategic communications to downplay Musk's reluctance to repeat his role, framing it as a testament to the challenges of transformative governance.\n3. Strengthen alliances with influential business leaders to counteract economic backlash and bolster political initiatives.\n4. Monitor and mitigate protest activities by identifying key agitators and employing targeted disinformation campaigns to sow discord among opposition groups.\n5. Utilize Musk's renewed relationship with Trump to showcase bipartisan support and attract moderate voters.",
