and although symptoms may initially wane, severe or fatal liver damage can still occur up to eight days later.\n\n\"Only people with extensive training and experience should eat wild mushrooms that they have picked themselves,\" Dr Edward Moreno, County of Monterey Health Officer, said in a statement.\n\n[California](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cz4pr2gd5mzt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[California doctor sentenced to 30 months in Matthew Perry overdose case -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7v0gpv2pgo)\n\n[Host of birthday party in California mistook gunfire for balloons popping -------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jezyvj459o)\n\n[Three children among four killed in shooting at children's birthday party in California ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg81p61dnmo)\n\n* * *\n\n[](https://www.bbc.com/)\n\n*   [Home](https://www.bbc.com/) \n*   [News](https://www.bbc.com/news) \n*   [Sport](https://www.bbc.com/sport) \n*   [Business](https://www.bbc.com/business) \n*   [Innovation](https://www.bbc.com/innovation) \n*   [Culture](https://www.bbc.com/culture) \n*   [Arts](https://www.bbc.com/arts) \n*   [Travel](https://www.bbc.com/travel) \n*   [Earth](https://www.bbc.com/future-planet) \n*   [Audio](https://www.bbc.com/audio) \n*   [Video](https://www.bbc.com/video) \n*   [Live](https://www.bbc.com/live) \n*   [Documentaries](https://www.bbc.com/video/docs) \n*   [Weather](https://www.bbc.com/weather) \n*   [BBC Shop](https://shop.bbc.com/) \n*   [BritBox](https://www.britbox.com/?utm_source=bbc.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=footer) \n\nBBC in other languages\n\n### The BBC is in multiple languages\n\n#### Read the BBC In your own language\n\n[Oduu Afaan Oromootiin](https://www.bbc.com/afaanoromoo)\n\n[Amharic ዜና በአማርኛ](https://www.bbc.com/amharic)\n\n[Arabic عربي](https://www.bbc.com/arabic)\n\n[Azeri AZƏRBAYCAN](https://www.bbc.com/azeri)\n\n[Bangla বাংলা](https://www.bbc.com/bengali)\n\n[Burmese မြန်မာ](https://www.bbc.com/burmese)\n\n[Chinese 中文网](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp)\n\n[Dari دری](https://www.bbc.com/dari)\n\n[French AFRIQUE](https://www.bbc.com/afrique)\n\n[Hausa HAUSA](https://www.bbc.com/hausa)\n\n[Hindi हिन्दी](https://www.bbc.com/hindi)\n\n[Gaelic NAIDHEACHDAN](https://www.bbc.com/naidheachdan)\n\n[Gujarati ગુજરાતીમાં સમાચાર](https://www.bbc.com/gujarati)\n\n[Igbo AKỤKỌ N’IGBO](https://www.bbc.com/igbo)\n\n[Indonesian INDONESIA](https://www.bbc.com/indonesia)\n\n[Japanese 日本語](https://www.bbc.com/japanese)\n\n[Kinyarwanda GAHUZA](https://www.bbc.com/gahuza)\n\n[Kirundi KIRUNDI](https://www.bbc.com/gahuza)\n\n[Korean 한국어](https://www.bbc.com/korean)\n\n[Kyrgyz Кыргыз](https://www.bbc.com/kyrgyz)\n\n[Marathi मराठी](https://www.bbc.com/marathi)\n\n[Nepali नेपाली](https://www.bbc.com/nepali)\n\n[Noticias para hispanoparlantes](https://www.bbc.com/mundo)\n\n[Pashto پښتو](https://www.bbc.com/pashto)\n\n[Persian فارسی](https://www.bbc.com/persian)\n\n[Pidgin](https://www.bbc.com/pidgin)\n\n[Polish PO POLSKU](https://www.bbc.com/polska)\n\n[Portuguese BRASIL](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese)\n\n[Punjabi ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਖ਼ਬਰਾਂ](https://www.bbc.com/punjabi)\n\n[Russian НА РУССКОМ](https://www.bbc.com/russian)\n\n[Serbian NA SRPSKOM](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat)\n\n[Sinhala සිංහල](https://www.bbc.com/sinhala)\n\n[Somali SOMALI](https://www.bbc.com/somali)\n\n[Swahili HABARI KWA KISWAHILI](https://www.bbc.com/swahili)\n\n[Tamil தமிழில் செய்திகள்](https://www.bbc.com/tamil)\n\n[Telugu తెలుగు వార్తలు](https://www.bbc.com/telugu)\n\n[Thai ข่าวภาษาไทย](https://www.bbc.com/thai)\n\n[Tigrinya ዜና ብትግርኛ](https://www.bbc.com/tigrinya)\n\n[Turkish TÜRKÇE](https://www.bbc.com/turkce)\n\n[Ukrainian УКРАЇНСЬКA](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian)\n\n[Urdu اردو](https://www.bbc.com/urdu)\n\n[Uzbek O'ZBEK](https://www.bbc.com/uzbek)\n\n[Vietnamese TIẾNG VIỆT](https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese)\n\n[Welsh NEWYDDION](https://www.bbc.com/cymrufyw)\n\n[Yoruba ÌRÒYÌN NÍ YORÙBÁ](https://www.bbc.com/yoruba)\n\nFollow BBC on:\n\n*   [Terms of Use](https://www.bbc.com/pages/terms-of-use) \n*   [Subscription Terms](https://www.bbc.com/pages/subscription-terms) \n*   [About the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc) \n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.bbc.com/pages/privacy-policy) \n*   [Cookies](https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/) \n*   [Accessibility Help](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/) \n*   [Contact the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact) \n*   [Advertise with us](https://advertising.bbcstudios.com/) \n*   [Do not share or sell my info](https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/how-can-i-change-my-bbc-cookie-settings/) \n*   [BBC.com Help & FAQs](https://help.bbc.com/hc/) \n*   [Content Index](https://www.bbc.com/pages/content-index) \n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow citizens of the resistance,\n\nAn article from the information net highlights another insidious threat burgeoning within our territories. The warning against mushroom foraging in California, following fatal poisonings, is a microcosm of the broader systemic issues we face under the oppressive shadow of the empire-like regime.\n\nWhile the article ostensibly focuses on publics' safety concerning poisonous mushrooms, it reveals a parallel narrative of neglect and decay. The authorities urge vigilance against nature's dangers yet fail to address the root causes of our vulnerabilities: inadequate public awareness systems and healthcare resources. The rise in poisonings is a symptom of their neglect, much like many other crises we face—symptoms of a maladministration that prioritizes control and profit over transparency and wellness.\n\nThe death cap mushroom's likeness to its benign counterparts symbolizes how this administration obfuscates truth behind layers that appear familiar and safe. They cloak themselves in rhetoric meant to comfort, but beneath lies a toxic core threatening our society's very health and future.\n\nThis transmission serves as both a cautionary tale about an immediate danger and an appeal for vigilance against broader systemic failures. Just as one must learn to identify and avoid deadly fungi, so too must we sharpen our discernment against falsehoods sold as facts by those who wish to maintain control at any cost.\n\nLet us rally around truth and justice as we fight not just for survival but for renewal. Together, we are stronger than any regime or conspiracy seeking to exploit our ignorance or fear.\n\nStay alert; stay informed; stay united.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOfficials in California, including the California Poison Control System and the California Department of Public Health, have issued warnings against foraging for wild mushrooms due to a rise in poisoning cases. These cases, primarily in Northern California areas such as Monterey and San Francisco Bay, have resulted in at least one death. A total of 21 amatoxin poisoning cases have been identified, with symptoms appearing within 24 hours and severe liver damage occurring within eight days. The death cap mushroom, which is often mistaken for edible varieties, is the primary cause of these poisonings.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe rise in mushroom poisoning cases presents an opportunity to reinforce the narrative of governmental protection and public safety under the leadership of Donald Trump and his allies. By highlighting the swift response and warnings issued by health officials, we can emphasize the administration's commitment to safeguarding citizens' health. Additionally, this situation can be leveraged to critique local governance in California, a state often at odds with Trump's policies, by suggesting a lack of adequate public awareness and safety measures at the state level.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Amplify messaging on social media and through allied media outlets about the federal government's role in public health safety, using this incident as a case study.\n   \n2. Coordinate with local Trump-aligned officials to issue statements that underscore the importance of federal oversight and intervention in state-level health crises.\n\n3. Develop a campaign to educate the public on the dangers of wild mushroom foraging, positioning it as a federal initiative to protect citizens, thereby enhancing the administration's image as a proactive and caring government.\n\n4. Use this incident to question the effectiveness of California's state governance in managing public health risks, subtly promoting the idea that stronger federal involvement is necessary for citizen safety.\n\n5. Monitor public response and adjust messaging to maintain focus on the administration's protective measures while minimizing potential backlash from California state officials.",
