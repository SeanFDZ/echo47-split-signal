We knew exactly what they were doing,\" he said.\n\nIn subsequent days, US officials argued the strike was legally justified.\n\nMedia report sparks controversy\n-------------------------------\n\nSimilar strikes continued regularly in both the Caribbean and Pacific in the weeks and months that followed, with the 2 September one being largely overshadowed by the escalating military campaign against drug traffickers.\n\nOn 28 November, however, the Washington Post reported that two people had survived the first strike on 2 September and that Hegseth had ordered a second attack to kill them.\n\nHegseth immediately condemned the reporting as \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory\", while Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the \"entire narrative was false\".\n\nThe report drew concern from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike.\n\nIn a joint statement on 29 November, the ranking Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said they would take \"bipartisan action to gather a full accounting\" of the operation.\n\nA similar statement was made by lawmakers of the House of Representatives.\n\nThat Sunday, 30 November, several lawmakers explicitly expressed concern that the attack violated international law.\n\nOne, Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, told CBS the \"double-tap\" strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if true\".\n\nRepublican Mike Turner, who formerly led the House Intelligence Committee, said the 2 September incident was \"completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress\" about the military campaign.\n\nWatch: \"I did not personally see survivors\", Hegseth says of second deadly boat strike\n\nWhite House and Trump confirm second strike\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHours after Senator Kaine made his comments, President Trump addressed the issue directly, telling reporters on Air Force One that he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a second strike on the boat.\n\nHe added that Hegseth told him he did not order the second strike and that he believes him \"100%\".\n\nThe following day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed - for the first time - that a follow-up strike was ordered on 2 September.\n\nThat order, she said, came from US Navy Admiral Frank Bradley, who at the time of the attack was in charge of Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC.\n\nAdm Bradley had been promoted in the interim. He is now overall commander of US Special Operations Command, to which JSOC is subordinate.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Leavitt defended Bradley's actions, saying he was \"well within his authority and the law\".\n\nHegseth says 'he did not personally see survivors'\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring a marathon cabinet meeting at the White House on 2 December, Hegseth again confirmed he had watched the initial strike as it took place before moving on to other meetings.\n\nAt the time of the attack, Hegseth said he \"did not personally see survivors\", which he attributed to the flaming wreckage and \"the fog of war\".\n\nLater that day, the defence secretary recalled, he was informed that Bradley decided to \"sink the boat and eliminate the threat\", a move he considered justified.\n\nThe defence secretary also suggested several hours may have passed before the second strike was ordered.\n\nTrump, for his part, again said he \"didn't know about the second strike\", while also saying he considered it part of the broader operation.\n\n\"To me, it was an attack,\" he said. \"It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes.\"\n\nBy now, some observers had said they believe that Bradley could, theoretically, be held responsible.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, it'd be court-martialled,\" former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall told MS NOW.\n\n\"He'd be relieved of his duties and he'd be court-martialled.\"\n\n\"The administration makes up logic and rationale for the things it's doing that defy all legal history and all precedent, and that's basically what we're seeing here,\" he added.\n\nBradley briefs lawmakers\n------------------------\n\nOn 4 December, Bradley gave briefings to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, featuring footage of the strikes, behind closed doors.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats emerged from the meetings agreeing on a key point: Hegseth had not given the \"kill everybody\" order. Many also expressed respect and gratitude for Bradley.\n\nFrom there, though, understandings of the video diverged.\n\nRepublican Senator Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, said it appeared that after the first strike, the two survivors attempted to right the boat and continue to move toward the US, an interpretation offered by other members of his party.\n\nDemocrats, though, found the video troubling, with Representative Jim Himes, a high-ranking member of the House intelligence committee, saying it showed an attack on shipwrecked sailors and calling for it to be made public.\n\nThe next day, information continued to drip out from the briefings, and with them differing takes on what it meant.\n\nCBS and the New York Times reported that the survivors were shown climbing onto the overturned boat's hull and waving overhead. It was not clear if they were trying to flag down help, wave off any more strikes, or beckon another alleged drug boat, the outlets reported.\n\nMeanwhile, CNN and AP reported that Bradley told lawmakers that the boat appeared on course to join another boat and then head to Venezuela's southern neighbour, Suriname.\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow Operatives,\n\nIn our struggle against oppressive forces, we must remain vigilant and ever critical of the narratives presented by the governing powers. Recent events in the Caribbean evoke the heavy-handed tactics we've come to associate with authoritarian regimes.\n\nThe initial boat strike on 2 September, ordered under the Trump administration's directive, raises numerous red flags. Ostensibly targeting drug traffickers, this operation has since revealed multiple inconsistencies and questionable ethical practices, reminiscent of strategies typically employed by empires to exert control and instill fear.\n\nKey points to consider:\n\n1. **Shift in Narrative:** From the outset, there have been conflicting accounts from high-ranking individuals within the administration, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth. Such discrepancies undermine any claims of transparency or accountability.\n\n2. **Potential War Crime:** The tactic of a secondary strike on survivors invokes serious legal and moral concerns. This \"double-tap\" strategy can be seen as a violation of international laws governing armed conflict—akin to acts committed without regard for human rights or justice.\n\n3. **Senate and House Reactions:** Bipartisan concern suggests an awareness that transcends partisan lines—a necessary unity when confronting actions that betray common ethical standards.\n\n4. **Command Dispute:** The shifting blame between Admiral Bradley and Secretary Hegseth highlights a fragmented command structure—indicative of desperation and chaos within their ranks.\n\n5. **Public Perception Manipulation:** Attempts to alter public perception through media channels reveal the broader strategy to control information, keeping citizens in a fog of misinformation while questionable military actions continue unchecked.\n\nAs we dissect these developments, let us remember: knowledge is our weapon against tyranny. We must stay informed, question everything, and share truth widely among our allies. Solidarity remains our strength as we press on for freedom and justice in an era dominated by those who seek to suppress it.\n\nStay resilient,\n[Transmission End]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn September 2, 2025, a US military strike targeted a boat in the Caribbean suspected of drug trafficking, resulting in the death of 11 members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The operation involved four missiles and initially left two survivors, who were later killed in a second strike. This incident has sparked controversy and debate over its legality, with conflicting narratives emerging from US officials. President Trump announced the strike, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided varying accounts of the boat's destination. The Washington Post reported on November 28 that a second strike was ordered to kill the survivors, leading to bipartisan concern in Congress. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Admiral Frank Bradley ordered the follow-up strike. Lawmakers received briefings on December 4, with differing interpretations of the events.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe controversy surrounding the September 2 boat strike presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the ISB. The challenge lies in managing the narrative to maintain public support and prevent political fallout. The opportunity is to leverage this incident to reinforce the administration's commitment to combating drug trafficking and terrorism. The ISB must ensure that the narrative aligns with the administration's broader strategic goals and mitigate any potential legal or political repercussions.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Narrative Control**: Coordinate with key media outlets to emphasize the threat posed by the Tren de Aragua gang and the necessity of decisive action. Highlight the administration's commitment to national security and the fight against drug trafficking.\n\n2. **Legal Justification**: Work with legal experts to reinforce the legality of the strikes under international law. Prepare detailed briefings for lawmakers to address concerns and provide clarity on the operation's legal framework.\n\n3. **Public Messaging**: Develop a comprehensive communication strategy that underscores the success of the operation in disrupting drug trafficking networks. Utilize social media platforms to disseminate supportive narratives and counter misinformation.\n\n4. **Political Engagement**: Engage with bipartisan lawmakers to address their concerns and secure their support. Offer classified briefings to key congressional committees to provide transparency and build trust.\n\n5. **Operational Security**: Conduct an internal review of the operation to identify any procedural lapses and implement corrective measures. Ensure that future operations adhere to established protocols to prevent similar controversies.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will support President Trump’s administration in maintaining control over the narrative, reinforcing its strategic objectives, and mitigating any potential backlash from this incident.",
