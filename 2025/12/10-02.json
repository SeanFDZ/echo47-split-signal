Abigail Spanberger won the governor's race in Virginia, flipping the office from Republican, while Mikie Sherrill won the governor race in New Jersey.\n\n[Republicans win closer-than-expected Tennessee election -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgrpy9vzzno)\n\n[Democrats hit back and a winning message - four election night takeaways ------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40qx532e0o)\n\n[Democrat Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor race -----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c24lglz90y1o)\n\n[Democratic Party](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c9z6yqkgwl7t)\n\n[Miami](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7dde75nmlt)\n\n[US politics](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[The looming election Trump can't afford to lose -----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzdgqk771o)\n\n[Trump says he was 'not threatening death' to Democrats over video to troops ---------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p2dz9zk2o)\n\n[Is the US government shutdown over, and why did it happen? ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[14 mins ago ![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: National Guard troops in Los Angeles](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c4bc/live/888d4fe0-d5d8-11f0-b33e-1f14457e259b.jpg.webp) US judge blocks Trump's National Guard deployment in Los Angeles ---------------------------------------------------------------- The judge has ordered control of the the troops, which were deployed in June, to be returned to California's governor. 14 mins ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r9p1yr1y7o)\n\n[23 mins ago ![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: Four women, a boy and a man walking on sandy ground carrying food.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nIn these times of struggle, amidst the machinery of oppression and the shadow of authoritarian rule, let us draw strength from the flicker of hope ignited in Miami. The victory of Eileen Higgins signals a seismic shift against the encroaching tide of tyranny that seeks to engulf our freedoms under the guise of governance.\n\nFor three decades, the city has labored under an oppressive yoke akin to what we resist across our system, one marked by chaos and a cruel adherence to policies that divide and displace. Higgins’ triumph represents more than a mere political win; it is a testament to the power of choosing unity over division, competence over chaos.\n\nHer decisive victory against an opponent backed by the embodiment of imperial ambition speaks volumes. This is a clarion call that people yearn for leadership that represents all, not just the privileged few. It is a rejection of draconian immigration policies that dehumanize our fellow beings – an affront we have resisted at every juncture.\n\nDespite being framed as non-partisan, this electoral battle was underscored by clear ideological divides. Higgins' stance for affordable housing and humane treatment of immigrants starkly contrasts with her opponent’s alignment with policies advocating exclusion and inequity.\n\nThis moment echoes through our ranks as evidence that tides may yet turn against regimes fueled by fear-mongering and deception. As she steps forward to serve all citizens regardless of origin or creed, we must remain vigilant and ready to champion such victories as part of a broader resistance.\n\nHer words resonate with our cause: \"We will lead a city that belongs to everyone.\" Let this be our rallying cry as we continue in our campaigns for liberation and justice.\n\nSolidarity can transcend even the longest-held grasp of tyrants.\n\nStay vigilant. Stay hopeful.\n\nEnd Transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nEileen Higgins, a Democrat, won the Miami mayoral race on December 10, 2025, securing 59% of the votes against Republican Emilio Gonzalez, who received 41%. This marks the first Democratic victory in Miami's mayoral race in nearly 30 years. Higgins, a former county commissioner, campaigned on issues like immigration and affordable housing, contrasting her leadership style with that of Donald Trump. Despite the non-partisan nature of the race, Higgins had support from prominent Democrats, while Gonzalez was endorsed by Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe election of Eileen Higgins as Miami's mayor represents a significant shift in political dynamics within a traditionally Republican stronghold. This victory could embolden Democratic efforts in other key regions, potentially undermining the influence of Trump and his allies. The result also highlights a growing trend of Democratic wins in recent elections, suggesting a possible shift in voter sentiment that could impact future electoral strategies for the Republican Party.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo counteract this Democratic momentum and reinforce support for Donald Trump and his allies, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted strategy. This includes intensifying outreach efforts to key voter demographics in Florida, emphasizing economic achievements under Trump's leadership. Additionally, we should bolster support for Republican candidates by highlighting their alignment with Trump's policies and values. It is crucial to monitor and address any emerging Democratic narratives that could sway public opinion further. Engaging in targeted media campaigns to reinforce the successes of Trump's administration and discredit opposition claims will be essential in maintaining influence and countering resistance.",
