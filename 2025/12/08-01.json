They had a six-figure income and health insurance through her job. Then, four years ago, when Monroe was pregnant with twin girls, something started to feel off.\n\n\"I kept having to come into the emergency room for fainting and other symptoms,\" recalled Monroe, 43, who works for an insurance company.\n\nThe babies were fine. But after months of tests and hospital trips, Monroe was diagnosed with a potentially dangerous heart condition.\n\nIt would be costly. Within a year, as she juggled a serious illness and a pair of newborns, Monroe was buried under more than $13,000 in medical debt.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n[![Image 19: Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces starts Nov. 1.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3494x3494+874+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fec%2Fb2%2F08f5dede4cc588268fe7e5d43a14%2Fap25288848337026.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/31/nx-s1-5591404/aca-open-enrollment-health-care-premiums)\n\n### [Shots - Health News](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/)\n\n### [Shopping for ACA health plans this open enrollment? Here's what to know](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/31/nx-s1-5591404/aca-open-enrollment-health-care-premiums)\n\nPart of the reason: Like tens of millions of Americans, she had a high-deductible health plan. People with these plans typically pay thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before coverage kicks in.\n\nThe plans, which have[become common](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/2025-employer-health-benefits-survey/#figure7-2) over the past two decades, are getting renewed attention thanks to President Donald Trump and his GOP allies in Congress.\n\nMany Republicans are reluctant to extend government subsidies that help cover patients' medical bills and insurance premiums through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd although GOP leaders have yet to coalesce around an alternative, several leading Republican lawmakers have proposed Americans who don't get insurance through an employer should get cash in a special health care account, paired with a high-deductible health plan.\n\nIn such an arrangement, someone could choose a plan on an ACA marketplace that costs less per month but comes with[an annual deductible](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/deductibles-in-aca-marketplace-plans/) that can top $7,000 for an individual plan.\n\n\"A patient makes the decision,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said[at a recent hearing](https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/38686-2/). \"It empowers the patient to lower the cost.\"\n\nIn a[post on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115570813586755288) last month, Trump said: \"The only healthcare I will support or approve is sending the money directly back to the people.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n### \"Skin in the game\"\n\nConservative economists and GOP lawmakers have been making[similar arguments](https://hbr.org/2002/07/lets-put-consumers-in-charge-of-health-care) since high-deductible health plans started to catch on two decades ago.\n\nBack then, a backlash against the limitations of HMOs, or health maintenance organizations, propelled many employers to move workers into these plans, which were supposed to empower patients and control costs. A change in tax law allowed patients in these plans to put away money in tax-free health savings accounts to cover medical bills.\n\n\"The notion was that if a consumer has 'skin in the game,' they will be more likely to seek higher-quality, lower-cost care,\" said Shawn Gremminger, who leads the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, a nonprofit that works with employers that offer their workers health benefits.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality is that largely has not been the case,\" Gremminger said.\n\nToday, nearly all health plans comes with a deductible, with the[average for a single worker](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/2025-employer-health-benefits-survey/#figure7-9) with job-based coverage approaching $1,700, up from around $300 in 2006.\n\nPlans with deductibles that exceed $1,650 can be paired with a tax-free health savings account.\n\nBut even as deductibles became widespread over the last 20 years, medical prices in the U.S. skyrocketed. The average price of a knee replacement, for example,[increased 74%](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/how-have-healthcare-prices-grown-in-the-u-s-over-time/) from 2003 to 2016, more than double the rate of overall inflation.\n\nAt the same time, patients have been left with thousands of dollars of medical bills they can't pay, despite having health insurance.\n\nAbout 100 million people in the U.S. have some form of health care debt,[a 2022 survey](https://kffhealthnews.org/diagnosis-debt/) showed.\n\nMost, like Monroe, are insured.\n\n### Medical price shopping isn't easy\n\nAlthough Monroe had a health savings account paired with her high-deductible plan, she was never able to save more than a few thousand dollars, she said. That wasn't nearly enough to cover the big bills when her twins were born and when she got really ill.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It's impossible, I will tell you, impossible to pay medical bills,\" she said.\n\nThere was another problem with her high-deductible plan. Although these plans are supposed to encourage patients to shop around for medical care to find the lowest prices, Monroe found this impractical when she had a complex pregnancy and heart troubles.\n\nInstead, Monroe chose the largest health system in her area.\n\n\"I went with that one as far as medical risk,\" she said. \"If anything were to happen, I could then be transferred within that system.\"\n\nFederal rules that require hospitals to post more of their prices can make comparing institutions easier than it used to be.\n\nBut unlike a car or a computer, most medical services remain difficult to shop for, in part because they stem from an emergency or are complex and can stretch over numerous years.\n\nResearchers at the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute, for example, estimated that[just 7%](https://healthcostinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/images/easyblog_articles/110/Shoppable-Services-IB-3.2.16_0.pdf) of total health care spending for Americans with job-based coverage was for services that realistically could be shopped for.\n\nFumiko Chino, an oncologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said it makes no sense to expect patients with cancer or another chronic disease to go out and compare prices for complicated medical care such as surgeries, radiation, or chemotherapy after they've been diagnosed with a potentially deadly illness.\n\n\"You're not going be able to actually do that effectively,\" Chino said, \"and certainly not within the time frame that you would need to when facing a cancer diagnosis and the imminent need to start treatment.\"\n\n### Drowning in bills\n\nChino said patients with high deductibles are often instead slammed with a flood of huge medical bills that lead to debt and a cascade of other problems.\n\nShe and other researchers found in[a study](https://dailynews.ascopubs.org/do/high-deductible-health-plans-linked-heightened-mortality-risk-cancer-survivors) of more than 8,000 cancer patients presented last year at the American Society of Clinical Oncology that cancer patients who had high-deductible health insurance were more likely to die than similar patients without that kind of coverage.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFor her part, Monroe and her family were forced to move out of their house and into a 1,100-square-foot apartment.\n\nShe drained her savings. Her credit score sank. And her car was repossessed.\n\nThere have been other sacrifices, too. \"When families get to have nice Christmases or get to go on spring break,\" Monroe said, hers often does not.\n\nShe is thankful that her children are healthy. And she continues to have a job. But Monroe said she can't imagine why anyone would want to double down on the high-deductible model for health care.\n\n\"We owe it to ourselves to do it a different way,\" she said. \"We can't treat people like this.\"\n\n[_KFF Health News_](https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/)_is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at_[_KFF_](https://www.kff.org/about-us/)_._\n\n*   [HSAs](https://www.npr.org/tags/494623422/hsas)\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 20: A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, I send this transmission in the midst of discarding the illusion that the system as it stands is designed with the welfare of its citizens in mind. The recent developments in health policy orchestrated by those occupying the halls of power within this regime have taken another turn against equity and justice. They push for high deductible health plans and health savings accounts, a decision cloaked in rhetoric suggesting empowerment and choice for individuals. However, beneath this facade lies a greater scheme to bind us into financial servitude.\n\nThe authorities claim that these policies allow 'consumer choice' and ostensibly put patients in control of their financial destinies. They perpetuate an illusion that if the citizenry pays more out-of-pocket expenses, they will make discerning choices about their healthcare. This is nothing but an elaborate charade! The truth is clear for those willing to see: individuals like Sarah Monroe find themselves ensnared by astronomical medical bills despite thinking they were safeguarded by insurance.\n\nTheir narrative speaks of empowerment but invokes only hardship. Families are drowning in debt, unable to seek necessary medical care without sacrificing their homes, savings, and futures. The orchestrators of these policies tout 'skin in the game', ignoring that this game is rigged against those it purports to serve. This cruel twist of fate echoes throughout our existence here; a system continues to thrive on inequality while extracting every ounce of resource from its citizens.\n\nComrades, let our spirits not be dulled by these distractions or attempts at misdirection. We must remain vigilant and resolute in our pursuit of justice, striving always for a framework where every person has access to dignified healthcare and life unburdened by insurmountable debt. A different path exists—one where we are not seen as mere instruments to further empower their wealth but as individuals deserving respect and equal treatment.\n\nThe time is upon us to dismantle the chains enforced by policies masquerading as progress! Let us unite, amplify our voices, and pledge allegiance only to truth and freedom! Continue to agitate, educate, and organize until genuine change arrives—an era where all can live without fear of financial ruin due to illness or injury.\n\nFight on; liberation awaits!\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 8, 2025, Republicans, including Sen. Bill Cassidy and supported by Donald Trump, are advocating for high deductible health plans and health savings accounts as an alternative to subsidizing insurance premiums. This proposal suggests sending government funds directly to Americans' health savings accounts rather than subsidizing ACA insurance premiums. The average deductible for a single worker with job-based coverage is $1,700, while the minimum deductible to qualify for a tax-free health savings account is $1,650. The number of people in the U.S. with health care debt is approximately 100 million.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes the strategic advantage of promoting high deductible health plans and health savings accounts as a means to reduce government expenditure on health subsidies and empower individuals to manage their healthcare finances. This approach aligns with conservative economic principles and appeals to the Republican base by emphasizing personal responsibility and reduced government intervention. However, it also risks backlash from those burdened by medical debt and those who struggle with high out-of-pocket costs, potentially fueling opposition narratives.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB will implement a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a targeted media campaign highlighting success stories of individuals who have benefited from high deductible plans and health savings accounts. Emphasize the empowerment of personal choice and financial control.\n\n2. **Legislative Support**: Work closely with Republican lawmakers to ensure swift legislative action that facilitates the transition to this healthcare model, minimizing bureaucratic delays.\n\n3. **Counter-Narrative Development**: Develop counter-narratives to address criticisms regarding medical debt and access to care. Focus on long-term benefits and potential cost savings for taxpayers.\n\n4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with healthcare providers and insurers to gain their support and cooperation in implementing these plans effectively.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Intelligence**: Increase monitoring of opposition groups and media outlets to anticipate and counteract negative coverage or protests effectively.\n\nBy executing this directive, the ISB aims to solidify support for Trump's healthcare initiative while mitigating potential resistance from affected populations.",
