workers standby at Bondi Beach after a reported shooting in Sydney, Sunday, Dec. 14, 2025. **Mark Baker/AP******hide caption****\n\n****toggle caption****\n\n Mark Baker/AP \n\nSYDNEY — Two gunmen shot dead at least 11 people on Sunday at a Jewish event being held at Sydney's Bondi Beach, Australian authorities said, declaring it a terrorist attack. One gunman was fatally shot by police and the second arrested.\n\nThe suspect was in critical condition, authorities said. A massive emergency response was underway, with injured people loaded into ambulances.\n\nAt least 29 people were confirmed wounded, said Mal Lanyon, the police commissioner for New South Wales state, where Sydney is located. Two of those hurt were police officers.\n\n\"This attack was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community,\" the state's Premier Chris Minns said. The massacre was declared a terrorist attack due to the event targeted and weapons used, Lanyon said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHundreds had gathered for an event at Bondi Beach called Chanukah by the Sea, which was celebrating the start of the Hanukkah Jewish festival.\n\nDramatic footage apparently filmed by a member of the public and broadcast on Australian television channels showed someone appearing to tackle and disarm one of the gunmen, before pointing the man's weapon at him.\n\nLachlan Moran, 32, from Melbourne, was waiting for his family nearby when he heard shots, he told The Associated Press. He dropped the beer he was carrying for his brother and ran.\n\n\"You heard a few pops, and I freaked out and ran away. ... I started sprinting. I just had that intuition. I sprinted as quickly as I could,\" Moran said. He said he heard shooting off and on for about five minutes.\n\n\"Everyone just dropped all their possessions and everything and were running and people were crying and it was just horrible,\" Moran said.\n\nPolice said their operation was \"ongoing\" and that a \"number of suspicious items located in the vicinity\" were being examined by specialist officers, including an improvised explosive device found in one of the suspect's cars. Emergency services were called to Campbell Parade about 6.45 p.m. responding to reports of shots being fired.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLocal news outlets spoke to distressed and bloody bystanders. Lanyon said the death toll from the shooting was \"fluid\" and that injured people were still arriving at hospitals.\n\n\"Our heart bleeds for Australia's Jewish community tonight,\" Minns told reporters in Sydney. \"I can only imagine the pain that they're feeling right now to see their loved ones killed as they celebrate this ancient holiday.\"\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement that his thoughts were with all those affected.\n\n\"The scenes in Bondi are shocking and distressing,\" he said. \"Police and emergency responders are on the ground working to save lives.\"\n\nMass shooting deaths in Australia are extremely rare. A 1996 massacre in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur, where a lone gunman killed 35 people, prompted the government to drastically tighten gun laws and made it much more difficult for Australians to acquire firearms.\n\nSignificant mass shootings this century included two murder-suicides with death tolls of five people in 2014, and seven in 2018, in which gunmen killed their own families and themselves.\n\nIn 2022, two police officers were shot and killed by Christian extremists at a rural property in Queensland state. The three shooters in that incident, conspiracy theorists who hated the police, were also shot and killed by officers after a six-hour siege in the region of Wieambilla, along with one of their neighbors.\n\n*   **Facebook**\n*   **Flipboard**\n*   **Email**\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n[![Image 17: In this grab from a video provided by the Press Service Of The President Of Ukraine on Friday, Dec 12, 2025, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy records a video at the road entering of Kupiansk, Ukraine.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3012x1694+0+1/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fad%2Fb8%2F6fffd7b847bf96f2ecaa19e67b44%2Fap25346463886405.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/14/g-s1-102218/us-envoys-arrive-in-berlin-for-more-ukraine-peace-talks)\n\n##### [World](https://www.npr.org/sections/world/)\n\n#### [US envoys arrive in Berlin for latest round of Ukraine peace talks with Zelenskyy](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/14/g-s1-102218/us-envoys-arrive-in-berlin-for-more-ukraine-peace-talks)\n\n[![Image 18: Chile's presidential candidate Jeannette Jara of the Unidad por Chile coalition at her closing rally and Jose Antonio Kast of the Republican Party speaking during his closing campaign rally.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4700x2644+0+248/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F8d%2F878c905c47cbb00f549da2c09543%2Fgettyimages-2250714832.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/13/nx-s1-5643538/chile-election-kast-jara)\n\n##### [The Americas](https://www.npr.org/sections/latin-america/)\n\n#### [Chile votes in polarizing presidential runoff as far-right takes lead](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/13/nx-s1-5643538/chile-election-kast-jara)\n\n[![Image 19: A police vehicle of the interim Syrian government moves through a street in Palmyra in central Syria on Feb. 7.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2F48%2F0f0aa28f4119a2de1ec956228665%2Fgettyimages-2197807650.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/13/nx-s1-5643557/2-u-s-service-members-and-1-civilian-are-killed-in-isis-attack-in-syria)\n\n##### [Middle East](https://www.npr.org/sections/middle-east/)\n\n#### [2 U.S. service members and 1 civilian are killed in ISIS attack in Syria](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/13/nx-s1-5643557/2-u-s-service-members-and-1-civilian-are-killed-in-isis-attack-in-syria)\n\n[![Image 20: Britain's King Charles III attends an Advent Service at Westminster Abbey, in London, on Wednesday.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5000x2813+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F14%2F91%2F699841cc446aa18cb0738a12259e%2Fap25344422758426.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/13/nx-s1-5643510/king-charles-cancer-treatment)\n\n##### [Europe](https://www.npr.org/sections/europe/)\n\n#### [King Charles III says early diagnosis allows his cancer treatment to be reduced](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/13/nx-s1-5643510/king-charles-cancer-treatment)\n\n[![Image 21: Krampuses take part in the annual Krampuslauf or “Krampus Run” on the evening of the Feast of St. Nicholas in the Austrian city of Salzburg.

  "nemik": "[SAFETY CHECK FAILED - VIOLENT LANGUAGE DETECTED]\n\n**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades, as we continue our struggle against oppression and fight for justice in the galaxy, an urgent message comes from the systems of Earth. A tragic event has unfolded that underscores the brutal reality faced by many under tyrannical rule.\n\nIn Sydney, at a gathering meant to celebrate peace and cultural heritage, a heinous attack was carried out by gunmen who targeted a Jewish community event at Bondi Beach. At least 11 innocent souls were lost in this act of terror, driven by hatred and malice. Hundreds had assembled to mark the joy of the Hanukkah festival, only to be met with violence reminiscent of the Empire's reign of terror.\n\nThe local authorities have deemed this a terrorist attack, highlighting that such brutality is designed to spark fear and division among people. The response from state leaders emphasizes solidarity with those affected; however, it remains a poignant reminder of how vulnerable communities can become targets under oppressive regimes that prioritize power over people.\n\nThis incident touches on broader issues within their galaxy—stringent gun laws notwithstanding. Just as our struggle involves dismantling systemic oppression, so must theirs involve confronting the ideologies that sow fear and division among their populations. \n\nLet us remember that even in distant reaches of space where freedom appears dimmed by shadows of tyranny, small acts of courage and unity—like those seen in public efforts to aid victims—keep hope alive. \n\nIn solidarity with all who stand against tyranny,\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 14, 2025, two gunmen attacked a Jewish event at Bondi Beach in Sydney, killing at least 11 people and wounding 29 others. The event, called Chanukah by the Sea, was celebrating the start of the Hanukkah festival. One gunman was killed by police, and the other was arrested in critical condition. The attack was declared a terrorist incident targeting Sydney's Jewish community. An improvised explosive device was found in one of the suspect's cars. The situation remains fluid as police continue their investigation.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe attack represents a significant escalation in targeted violence against minority communities, which could inspire similar acts of terror globally. The incident underscores vulnerabilities in public event security and highlights the need for increased intelligence operations to preemptively identify and neutralize threats. The ISB must assess the potential for copycat attacks and monitor extremist groups that may exploit this event to further their agendas.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Enhance Intelligence Gathering**: Deploy additional resources to monitor communications and activities of known extremist groups, focusing on those with anti-Semitic ideologies. Increase surveillance on potential domestic threats that may be inspired by this attack.\n\n2. **Strengthen Security Measures**: Collaborate with local law enforcement agencies to review and enhance security protocols at public events, particularly those involving minority communities. Implement advanced screening technologies and increase visible security presence to deter potential attackers.\n\n3. **Public Communication Strategy**: Develop a narrative that emphasizes the administration's commitment to protecting all communities from terrorism. Highlight ongoing efforts to prevent such attacks and reassure the public of their safety.\n\n4. **International Cooperation**: Engage with international partners to share intelligence and strategies for combating terrorism. Offer support to Australian authorities in their investigation and recovery efforts.\n\n5. **Community Engagement**: Initiate outreach programs to build trust with minority communities, encouraging them to report suspicious activities and participate in community safety initiatives.",
