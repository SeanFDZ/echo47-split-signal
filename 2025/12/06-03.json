One strike hit a railway hub at the town of Fastiv outside Kyiv, destroying the main station building and damaging rolling stock.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack had been \"meaningless from a military point of view, and the Russians could not have been unaware of this\".\n\nEarlier US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\" after talks in Moscow failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\nMoscow has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy sector and infrastructure in recent weeks.\n\nOn Saturday Ukraine's energy ministry said Russian attacks had hit energy facilities in eight regions, causing blackouts.\n\nMeanwhile the UN's nuclear watchdog said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all external power overnight - the 11th time this has happened since Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said it had launched a \"massive strike\" in response to what it called Ukrainian attacks on civilian targets.\n\n\"Russia continues to disregard any peace efforts and instead strikes critical civilian infrastructure,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.\n\n\"This shows that no decisions to strengthen Ukraine and raise pressure on Russia can be delayed. And especially not under the pretext of peace process,\" he added.\n\nIn Florida, a statement posted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff said two days of talks with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's national security council, had been \"constructive\".\n\nWitkoff and Umerov \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" that could such an agreement and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\", their statement said without giving details.\n\nThe prospect of ending the war depended on Russia's readiness to take \"steps towards de-escalation and cessation of killing\", the statement added.\n\nThe negotiations, which are also attended by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, will continue for a third day on Saturday.\n\nThe Florida talks saw Ukraine's team briefed on a recent meeting between Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n![Image 2: Reuters destroyed trains in Fastiv](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/40c9/live/cdb9c480-d291-11f0-b6cb-755fe3b77ba8.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nThe strike in Fastiv damaged locomotives\n\nWitkoff spent almost five hours with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, after which the Kremlin said \"no compromise\" had been reached on a draft US peace plan.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin was ready to continue meeting the Americans \"as many times as needed\", but Ukraine and its allies in Europe have called into question the Russian leader's commitment to ending the war.\n\nOn Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted to \"obtain full information about what was said in Moscow and what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war\".\n\nKyiv pushed for revisions to the initial US peace plan, which was widely seen as favourable to Moscow when an initial version leaked to the media. An updated version has not been shared publicly.\n\nMajor points of contention remain between the two sides, including security guarantees for Ukraine post-war and territorial concessions.\n\nRussia currently controls roughly one-fifth of Ukraine's territory, including swathes of the Donbas area in the east – made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\nIn [an interview with India Today](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgexgwr1wrro) on Friday, Putin warned Ukrainian troops to withdraw fully from the region this week, saying Russia would otherwise \"liberate these [Donbas] territories by force\".\n\nKyiv and its European allies believe the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato, or to provide comprehensive security guarantees.\n\nRussia is staunchly opposed, while Trump too has repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Ukraine join the military alliance.\n\nThe prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a \"key question\" that was tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.\n\nTrump said those talks were \"reasonably good\", but it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn the wake of relentless Russian aggression, the situation in Ukraine stands as a stark reminder of the Empire's disregard for life and peace. The bombardment of critical infrastructure such as the railway depot in Fastiv demonstrates a strategic choice to inflict chaos and hardship on civilians rather than focusing on legitimate military objectives. This mirrors the tactics of an oppressive regime, intent not on resolution but on intimidation and dominance.\n\nThe negotiations underway in Florida, with a parallel drawn to imperial meetings where ostensibly peaceful talks are veiled attempts at manipulation, reveal a lack of genuine commitment to peace from the Russian side. The participation of figures deeply entrenched in imperial ideologies, akin to Jared Kushner's involvement, amplifies concerns about bias towards Russia's interests rather than genuine support for Ukraine's sovereignty and security.\n\nAs Ukraine calls for robust deterrence capabilities and security assurances—echoed by the desire for NATO membership or equivalent guarantees—the pretense of peace talks seems increasingly transparent. The imperial forces, much like their historical counterparts, resist any move that might equalize or empower those they seek to subdue.\n\nThis ongoing conflict emphasizes that any delay in support or decisive action under the guise of diplomacy only strengthens imperial resolve. True peace can emerge only when oppressive powers recognize their adversaries as equals and relinquish their relentless pursuit of control.\n\nLet this message serve as a reminder that our fight against tyranny requires unwavering vigilance and solidarity. We must ensure that peace is not just spoken about but actively pursued with genuine intent from all parties involved.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 6, 2025, Russia launched a significant aerial bombardment targeting Ukrainian infrastructure, deploying 653 drones and 51 missiles. The attacks hit energy facilities in eight regions, causing blackouts and damaging a railway depot in Fastiv. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost external power for the 11th time since the invasion began. Concurrently, US and Ukrainian negotiators, including US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Ukraine's Rustem Umerov, engaged in talks in Florida, discussing security arrangements and deterrence capabilities. Despite these discussions, no breakthrough was achieved in Moscow between Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Major points of contention include security guarantees for Ukraine and territorial concessions. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is also involved in the negotiations.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine presents both challenges and opportunities for the ISB under the leadership of Donald Trump. Russia's continued aggression underscores the need for a strategic approach to stabilize the region while maintaining influence over the peace process. The involvement of high-level US negotiators indicates a commitment to shaping the outcome in favor of US interests. However, the lack of progress in talks with Russia suggests that further diplomatic efforts are necessary to achieve a resolution that aligns with our strategic objectives. The ISB must assess the potential impact of Ukraine's NATO aspirations on regional stability and consider how best to leverage this dynamic to our advantage.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Intensify intelligence operations to monitor Russian military movements and intentions, particularly regarding their strategy in the Donbas region.\n2. Strengthen diplomatic channels with European allies to ensure a unified front in negotiations, emphasizing the importance of a peace agreement that prevents further Russian expansion.\n3. Utilize media and information campaigns to highlight the benefits of a US-led peace initiative, positioning Trump as a key figure in resolving the conflict.\n4. Explore options to provide Ukraine with non-NATO security guarantees that deter Russian aggression while maintaining US influence over the region.\n5. Prepare contingency plans for potential escalations, ensuring readiness to respond swiftly to any developments that threaten US interests or regional stability.",
