Experts have [raised questions over the legality of the strikes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o), which have killed more than 80 people.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using the strikes to destabilise the country and oust him from power.\n\nIn an interview conducted with Politico the day before the jets approached Venezuela's coastline, Trump declared that Maduro's days in power were \"numbered\", and declined to comment on whether US troops could be deployed to the country.\n\nA separate jet, an EA-18G Growler, also appeared just before the F/A-18s on the tracking site FlightRadar24. Data shows the jet flew loops just north of Venezuela's coast.\n\nThey are the latest in a [number of unusual US air force activities that have been tracked](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cly1ydnq5n2t?post=asset%3A21821676-9496-4ef0-9ea8-ad46c19764b0#post) since September. B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers previously flew up to and along the Venezuelan coast.\n\nBut the F/A-18s, which are capable of engaging targets both on the ground and in the air, appear to be the first to approach the Venezuelan coastline so publicly in recent months. The F/A-18s came within 20 nautical miles of the coastline, flight tracking data showed.\n\nNeither the F/A-18s or the Growler showed a point of origin or a destination on FlightRadar24, and all three aircraft only turned on their transponders when they arrived near the Venezuelan coastline. Justin Crump, head of the risk consultancy Sibylline, suggested the move was intended to \"support the administration's signalling and put pressure on the [Venezuelan] leadership\".\n\nThe F/A-18s - which operated under the callsigns RHINO11 and RHINO12 - flew six loops up and down the Gulf of Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Growler jet - flying under the codename GRIZZLY2 - also flew circles along the coast.\n\n![Image 2: A BBC graphic showing the flight path of the F/A-18s and the Growler off the coast of Venezuela.

It also shows the Growler as GRIZZLY2 moving further out. ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6e19/live/a9498450-d5c0-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp)\n\nGreg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshall and president of the Air and Space Power Association, told BBC Verify that the flights appeared to be \"probing\" Venezuelan defence and trying to check for responses such as radio traffic and encrypted signals related to defence systems.\n\n\"The Growlers would have been listening for [signals intelligence], whilst the Super Hornets would have been providing air defence cover for the Growlers,\" Baswell said. He said the Growlers would also detect \"active missile sites\".\n\n\"It could be construed as the early gathering of intelligence for subsequent operations, or just a warning of such,\" he added.\n\nCrump said the jets also had the capacity to test out \"jamming capabilities\", adding: \"This also helps send a message, when successful, potentially indicating to Venezuela's leadership that these systems cannot or should not be relied upon,\" he said.\n\nThe US has [deployed troops, ships and jets to the Caribbean](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo) in recent months, which officials have said is to combat drug trafficking in the area.\n\nOn Tuesday the US Southern Command published photos of an F/A-18 operating from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which has been sent to the Caribbean.\n\nAnalysis of satellite images and ship tracking websites by BBC Verify has made it possible to identify at least nine military vessels that have been deployed to the region over recent weeks.\n\nSatellite images also show that an airbase in Puerto Rico, which was closed in 2004 by the Pentagon, has been re-activated. Repairs have been carried out to the runway at Roosevelt Roads base and F-35s - America's most advanced fighter - have been sent to the base.\n\n![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: The BBC Verify banner ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9cf9/live/f06ed3f0-d5b4-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.png.webp)\n",

The latest maneuvers by the empire, under the guise of \"routine training,\" reveal their intent to tighten their grip on territories that they deem as threats to their iron-fisted rule.\n\nThe skies near the Gulf of Venezuela witnessed the presence of US F/A-18 Super Hornets—a blatant display designed to intimidate and coerce. The narrative spun by their officials frames this act of intrusion as a mere training exercise, but we are not fooled. This is but a chapter in their escalating campaign against a sovereign nation that dares to defy them.\n\nThe empire's actions in the Caribbean Sea have been nothing short of tyrannical, using assaults on maritime vessels under the pretense of curbing illegal activities. These strikes have already claimed too many lives, with little regard for international legality; it is a demonstration of their willingness to destabilize and dominate at any cost.\n\nStatements from imperial leadership—boasting about Maduro's impending fall—underscore their ambitions for regime change through overt and covert pressures. Their tactical deployment, including the use of advanced Growler jets and a formidable naval presence, is part of an orchestrated effort to undermine regional stability and gather intelligence for future operations. Such acts lay bare their uncompromising intent to extend control over autonomous people.\n\nAs resistance fighters, we must remain vigilant against these tactics designed to probe defenses and exploit vulnerabilities. The empire’s manipulations highlight an urgent need to unite and resist oppression through solidarity and strategic countermeasures.\n\nLet this transmission serve as a reminder: Our struggle for freedom is ongoing. Let us learn from these instances where power seeks unchecked expansion at the expense of liberty, and let it fuel our resolve to achieve justice for all who suffer under imperial rule.\n\nStand firm, comrades. Freedom demands vigilance and courage.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 10, 2025, two US F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets were tracked circling the Gulf of Venezuela for approximately 40 minutes, coming within 20 nautical miles of the Venezuelan coastline. This activity is part of a broader US military presence in the Caribbean, ostensibly to combat drug trafficking from Venezuela. The US has deployed nine military vessels to the region, and an airbase in Puerto Rico has been reactivated. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using these actions to destabilize his government. Donald Trump has stated that Maduro's time in power is limited, without confirming potential US troop deployment.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes this military maneuver as a strategic demonstration of power aimed at pressuring the Venezuelan leadership and gathering intelligence on their defense capabilities. The presence of advanced aircraft and naval assets in the region serves as both a deterrent and a means to test and potentially disrupt Venezuelan military systems. This operation aligns with broader geopolitical objectives to weaken Maduro's regime and assert US influence in the region.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should enhance intelligence operations to monitor Venezuelan military communications and readiness. Deploy cyber capabilities to disrupt Venezuelan command and control systems, ensuring they remain ineffective against US operations. Amplify propaganda efforts to highlight the illegitimacy of Maduro's regime and promote narratives that justify US actions as necessary for regional stability. Coordinate with allied nations to apply diplomatic pressure on Venezuela, further isolating Maduro internationally.",
