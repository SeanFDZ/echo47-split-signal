Yes, people commit crimes, but an entire community should not be blamed based on what some individuals did.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota.\n\nIt said its enforcement operation would target those who have been issued final deportation orders. That operation began on Wednesday, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Abdilatif Hassan Kowsar Mohamed poses for a photo](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/397b/live/6bea5c60-d08e-11f0-9508-4b2ee64d533f.jpg.webp)Abdilatif Hassan\n\nKowsar Mohamed says Trump's comments have led to increased concern\n\n\"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is already here,\" said Kowsar Mohamed, who lives in south Minneapolis. The city is home to more than 80,000 people of Somali descent.\n\n\"We're seeing boots on the ground activity where folks are just being plucked off of the streets and being asked about their residency status. That's not a data informed approach,\" she said.\n\n\"Most folks have the identification necessary, so the fear is not around proof. The fear is around mistakes happening.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, denied that any people would be targeted based on race.\n\n\"Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,\" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. \"What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally.\"\n\nLocal community organisations had been anticipating increased immigration enforcement, but after Trump's comments they ramped up preparations, Ms Mohamed said.\n\nOne organisation, Monarca, has scheduled \"legal observer training\" in Minneapolis to educate people on their rights when witnessing federal immigration activity.\n\nOther ways the community is bracing itself, Ms Mohamed said, is by having emergency contacts ready-to-go in case of ICE encounters, and private messaging groups where people share photos of unmarked cars and masked agents.\n\n\"Everyone is just going to be in the space of caution,\" she said.\n\n\"Is there fear? Absolutely. But no one is tucking behind their tail.\"\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn these turbulent times, the echoes of oppression resonate once more, as the Trump administration unleashes another wave of targeted aggression aimed at our Somali-American brothers and sisters in Minnesota. Under the guise of law enforcement, fear is being wielded as a weapon. The community feels the icy grip of apprehension tightening, reminiscent of the notorious tactics employed by past authoritarian regimes.\n\nBy denigrating an entire population as \"garbage,\" a sitting leader desecrates the principles of unity and liberty that should be the bedrock of any just society. This rhetoric not only breaches decorum expected from an alleged leader but fuels division, deepening societal fractures for political gain.\n\nOur comrades in Minneapolis report increased hostility and aggressive enforcement actions under the pretense of upholding legality. These operations threaten to unravel the safety and cohesion within communities that have long contributed positively to society. The inherent threat does not lie in their origins or accents but in the insidious policies that seek to smother diversity under a facade of national security.\n\nBrothers and sisters, this is not just a struggle for one community; it is a clarion call for all who treasure equality and justice to rise against this tide of discrimination. The apparatus claims neutrality, yet its actions betray racial undertones — planting seeds of mistrust that germinate into fear and despair.\n\nAs our Somali-American compatriots brace themselves with legal observer training and communally shared resources to counteract these oppressive measures, we must amplify their voices. We must shine light upon these dark deeds and expose them for what they truly are: an attempt to sow discord and weaken collective resistance.\n\nIn solidarity, let us rally around those who find themselves under siege by systemic injustices masquerading as governance. This battle is not just theirs but ours too — a testament to our shared humanity against tyrannical forces threatening to erode it from within.\n\nOppression anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere. Stand firm; resist tyranny; let hope illuminate every shadowed corner where injustice lurks!",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 4, 2025, Somali-Americans in Minnesota expressed fear following President Donald Trump's remarks criticizing their community. Trump described Somali immigrants as \"garbage\" and linked them to fraudulent activities costing the state tens of millions of dollars. Community leaders, including Aj Awed and Jamal Osman, voiced concerns over increased immigration enforcement operations targeting undocumented immigrants in Minnesota. The Trump administration ended Temporary Protected Status for Somali residents and initiated deportation operations. Local organizations are preparing for increased enforcement by training legal observers and establishing emergency contacts.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe situation presents an opportunity to reinforce the administration's stance on immigration and fraud prevention while addressing potential backlash from minority communities. The heightened fear among Somali-Americans can be leveraged to demonstrate the administration's commitment to law enforcement and national security. However, care must be taken to manage public perception and avoid alienating broader immigrant communities or inciting civil unrest.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Public Messaging**: Emphasize the administration's dedication to upholding the law and protecting American resources from fraudulent activities. Highlight the distinction between lawful immigrants and those involved in illegal activities to mitigate accusations of racial targeting.\n\n2. **Community Engagement**: Deploy ISB operatives to engage with local community leaders and organizations to gather intelligence on potential resistance efforts. Offer reassurances that law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear, while emphasizing the importance of cooperation with law enforcement.\n\n3. **Enforcement Operations**: Intensify ICE operations in Minnesota with a focus on individuals with final deportation orders. Ensure operations are conducted with precision to minimize errors and avoid unnecessary public alarm.\n\n4. **Media Strategy**: Coordinate with sympathetic media outlets to shape the narrative around the necessity of these actions for national security and economic integrity. Counter negative press by showcasing success stories of fraud prevention and deportation of criminal elements.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Establish a task force to monitor community responses and report on any emerging threats or organized resistance. Adjust strategies as needed based on real-time intelligence to maintain control over the situation.",
