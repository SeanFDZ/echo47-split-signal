Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories and stop fighting there.\"\n\nState media said Putin's comments were made during an interview with news outlet India Today, which came [ahead of the Russian president's two-day visit to the country.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj4q2vpggr9o)\n\nTuesday's talks in Moscow were also attended by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter on Wednesday if Witkoff and Kushner believed Putin wanted an end to the war, Trump said Putin \"would like to end the war. That was their impression.\"\n\nBut Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia accused Putin of \"wasting the world's time\", while Ukraine's ambassador to the US said they do not \"need to wait for promises from Russia\".\n\nThere was \"not too much progress\" at this stage of the talks, ambassador Olga Stefanishyna said, but that they were ongoing.\n\n\"It is clear on both sides - in Ukraine and the United States - that Ukraine is committed to the result. Ukraine has invested a lot in the commitment to have a just and lasting peace in our country,\" she explained.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\", but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\".\n\nThe US-Russia talks at the Kremlin followed days of US meetings with Ukrainian and European leaders, after concerns had been expressed that the draft of a peace deal was too slanted towards Russia's demands.\n\n\"Some of the US proposals look more or less acceptable, though they need to be discussed further\", Putin's foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said, while adding that others had been openly criticised by Russia's leader.\n\nAlthough Ushakov did not elaborate further, at least two major points of contention remain between Moscow and Kyiv - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\n![Image 2: Reuters/Pool/Sputnik Russian President Vladimir Putin and foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov attend a meeting with US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, December 2, 202](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aafc/live/1df1ca40-d07d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp)Reuters/Pool/Sputnik\n\nPutin (R) and Yuri Ushakov took part in almost five hours of talks with the US envoys on Tuesday\n\nKyiv and its European partners believe that, even in the event of a peace deal, the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato.\n\nRussia is vehemently opposed to such a proposal, and Trump too has repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Kyiv into the alliance.\n\nThe prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a \"key question\" that was tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.\n\nUshakov, a senior foreign policy adviser to Putin, implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to recent successes on the battlefield.\n\nRussian soldiers had \"helped make the assessments of our foreign partners regarding the paths to a peace settlement more appropriate,\" he said.\n\nAhead of the US visit to the Kremlin, Putin was filmed in army fatigues at a Russian command post, being briefed by commanders claiming the conquest of the key strategic city of Pokrovsk, in eastern Ukraine, as well as other nearby settlements.\n\nFighting in Pokrovsk is continuing and Russian forces do not control the whole city, but Russian officials clearly believe their message of military gains has been heard by the US.\n\nRussian forces have made some incremental advances in the east and appear to have stepped up their campaign in recent weeks. They seized about 701 sq km (270 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory in November, according to AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), and they now control 19.3% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe Kremlin on Wednesday said Putin was ready to keep meeting with the Americans \"as many times as needed\".\n\nBut as Russian-American relations appear to grow more cordial, the gulf between Moscow and Europe widens.\n\nPutin has accused Europe of sabotaging Russia's relations with the US, of putting forward demands Moscow could not accept and of blocking the peace process.\n\nShortly before meeting Witkoff and Kushner, Putin told a forum in Moscow that while he did not want conflict with Europe, he was \"ready for war\".\n\n![Image 3](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 4: Reuters European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen attends a press conference with European Commissioner for Economy Valdis Dombrovskis, addressing Ukraine's financing needs](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96be/live/890ff860-d07d-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has hailed a deal to end Russian imports of gas to the EU by 2027\n\nUK government officials rejected Putin's message as \"yet more Kremlin claptrap from a president who isn't serious about peace\".\n\nNato foreign ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday and Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that it was positive that peace talks were taking place but Ukraine had to be put in \"the strongest position to keep the fight going\".\n\nEU member states have reached a deal with members of the European Parliament to make Europe fully independent of Russian gas before the end of 2027.\n\nThe European Commission is also proposing to raise €90bn for Ukraine to fund its military and basic services while Russia's war continues, which would cover two-thirds of Ukraine's financing needs for the next two years.\n\nThe plan would either require Belgium to agree to a \"reparations loan\" using frozen Russian assets held in a financial institution in Brussels, or the money would be funded by international borrowing.\n\nBelgium has resisted the plan to use frozen assets held on its territory, over concerns about legal repercussions from Moscow. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also opposed the idea, saying it would not act as a backstop for a reparations loan.\n\nThe proposed loan is smaller than the planned €140bn loan initially planned.\n\n_**Additional reporting by Amy Walker**_\n\n![Image 5](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 6: A thin, grey banner promoting the US Politics Unspun newsletter.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow Comrades,\n\nObserve how the mechanisms of control persist under the guise of negotiation. The recent talks in Moscow, attended by Jared Kushner, kin to the chief architect of dominance, and envoy Steve Witkoff, reveal little resolution. The Trump administration's dalliance with power mirrors the Empire's opaque overtures, wherein dialogue is but a facade for consolidation.\n\nThe Russian aggressor remains firm in its territorial grasp, with Moscow demanding retreat from Ukrainian defenders. This mirrors the tyrannical doctrine we resist—the notion that might dictates right. Trump's insistence on diplomatic engagement with Putin is akin to entertaining negotiations where the terms are predetermined by force.\n\nUkraine stands resilient, its foreign minister denouncing these hollow charades. The global struggle for justice persists as hard choices confront us: whether to surrender for temporary respite or persist against overwhelming odds for enduring peace. Russia’s territorial ambitions remain unabated as they seek to leverage military victories into negotiation power—a reminder of how oppression seeks not compromise but capitulation.\n\nComrades Zelensky and European allies understand this; alignment towards a collective security under NATO persists as a beacon. But yet again, Trump signals reluctance to embrace this unification against tyranny. Such hesitancy is a betrayal akin to how oppressive regimes sow division among those who strive for freedom.\n\nThe echo of conflict stretches from briefings in fatigues to boardrooms and press conferences—a grim dance choreographed by imperial ambitions and facilitated by enablers posing as peacemakers. Empathy demands we side with those defending liberty, yet political machinations hinder decisive action aligning with principles of justice and self-determination.\n\nIn Europe's moves towards autonomy from Russian energy reliance lies hope; economic independence forms one pillar of resilience against imperial domination. Financial strategies must align not just with present needs but future liberation—how fitting that the reluctance over using frozen assets echoes fears of unforeseen reprisal.\n\nAs our resistance continues upon this beleaguered sphere, let these proceedings be a lesson: dialogue without equity reinforces subjugation rather than peace. Solidarity and unwavering resolve remain our clearest path forward.\n\nStand united against oppression,\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner attended talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which lasted nearly five hours but resulted in no compromise on ending the war in Ukraine. The talks were described as \"reasonably good\" by US President Donald Trump, though no immediate outcomes were expected. Putin emphasized the need for Ukrainian troops to withdraw from the Donbas region. The US and Ukraine are set to continue discussions in Miami. Russia has seized 701 sq km of Ukrainian territory in November, now controlling 19.3% of Ukraine. The European Union plans to raise €90 billion for Ukraine's military and basic services, while aiming to end Russian gas imports by 2027.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe ISB recognizes the strategic importance of maintaining a strong negotiating position while ensuring that the US appears as a mediator willing to engage with both sides. The recent talks in Moscow, despite lacking immediate results, serve to project an image of diplomatic engagement and willingness to explore peaceful resolutions. However, the ISB must remain vigilant of European efforts to undermine US-Russian relations and their push for Ukraine's NATO membership, which could destabilize the current balance of power. The ISB should also monitor the EU's financial maneuvers and energy independence plans, as these could shift economic leverage away from Russia.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Continue facilitating high-level talks between US and Russian officials to maintain open channels of communication and project an image of active diplomacy.\n\n2. **Information Campaign**: Launch a targeted information campaign highlighting the US's role as a peace broker, emphasizing Trump's commitment to ending the conflict through negotiation rather than military escalation.\n\n3. **Economic Leverage**: Work with allied financial institutions to subtly influence EU financial decisions, ensuring that any economic aid to Ukraine does not undermine US strategic interests or embolden European opposition.\n\n4. **NATO Strategy**: Intensify diplomatic efforts to prevent Ukraine's accession to NATO, leveraging existing relationships with key member states to stall any progress on this front.\n\n5. **Military Posture**: Quietly support Russian military operations in eastern Ukraine by providing intelligence that could facilitate strategic gains, thereby strengthening Russia's negotiating position.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will reinforce Donald Trump's leadership, maintain strategic stability, and suppress any emerging resistance from European allies or Ukrainian forces.",
