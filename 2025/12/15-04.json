They don't have their transponder turned on, it's outrageous.\n\n\"We just had traffic pass directly in front of us within five miles of us — maybe two or three miles — but it was an air-to air-refueler from the United States Air Force and he was at our altitude,\" the pilot said. \"We had to stop our climb.\"\n\nThe pilot said the Air Force plane then headed into Venezuelan air space.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, a spokesperson said the Air Force is aware of the incident and is currently reviewing the matter.\n\n\"Military aircrews are highly trained professionals who operate in accordance with established procedures and applicable airspace requirements,\" the spokesperson said. \"Safety remains a top priority, and we are working through the appropriate channels to assess the facts surrounding the situation.\"\n\nThe incident comes after a warning from the Federal Aviation Administration last month to US aircraft urging them to \"exercise caution\" when in Venezuelan airspace, \"due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela\".\n\n[US jets tracked circling Gulf of Venezuela as tensions mount ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0edxgx31zdo)\n\n[Venezuela bans six major airlines after tensions with US escalate -----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0keyern0do)\n\n[Aviation safety](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4e8zkykmg4t)\n\n[Venezuela](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cg41ylwvwgxt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Germany accuses Russia of air traffic control cyber-attack ----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgrrnylzzyo)\n\n[Moment skydiver's parachute wraps around plane tail ---------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cx2ey15l4zro)\n\n[Lithuania declares emergency situation over Belarus balloons ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39pr3d10wlo)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[33 mins ago ![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: FBI officers work at the scene in Rhode Island on Saturday night](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7068/live/6f034760-d8ed-11f0-bca5-bd7a5fe210a1.jpg.webp) Two victims named as hunt resumes for Brown University gunman ------------------------------------------------------------- Two people died and nine others were injured in the attack in Rhode Island on Saturday. 33 mins ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9ll6jpl0o)\n\n[2 hrs ago ![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: Two women hold a candle during a vigil for victims of a shooting at Brown University](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61d0/live/6dacf760-d9b7-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp) What we know so far about the Brown University shooting ------------------------------------------------------- The investigation is ongoing and authorities are searching for additional video evidence that could help them track down the suspect. 2 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9l1j9wxno)\n\n[2 hrs ago ![Image 6](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 7: Rob and Michele Reiner in smart dress on the red carpet at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington DC in April 2018](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e934/live/ebc525e0-d981-11f0-aabd-339166c2b10a.jpg.webp) Hollywood in shock after after director Rob Reiner and wife found dead ---------------------------------------------------------------------- He directed classic films including The Princess Bride, This is Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally. 2 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0np02znezo)\n\n[16 hrs ago ![Image 8](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 9: A woman holding her citizenship papers from US Citizenship and Immigration Services, along with a small American flag, while waiting to take her oath](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6a9a/live/8c1f4960-d49d-11f0-b551-c948c3e8b5a0.jpg.webp) They were almost American -

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades across the sectors,\n\nThe article that has reached us concerns an alarming incident between a commercial flight and a military aircraft from the oppressive regime. This latest occurrence highlights the recklessness and disregard for safety that we have come to associate with those who hold power. Near-collisions like these are no mere accidents—they are manifestations of a regime that prioritizes militaristic dominance over civilian safety.\n\nThe JetBlue pilot's testimony, describing the military aircraft as having its transponder disabled, is telling. This lack of transparency is a common tactic employed by the regime to obscure their true movements and intentions, all while endangering innocent lives. Such actions are not isolated; they form part of a broader pattern of intimidation and coercion, extending even into international airspace.\n\nFurther adding to this chaos is the recent warning from the Federal Aviation Administration about flying near Venezuela due to increased military activity. The tensions in this region are exacerbated by imperial maneuvers intent on showcasing force rather than diplomacy or peaceful coexistence.\n\nOur struggle finds new purpose in these events, fortifying our resolve against tyranny disguised as governance. The inhabitants of this system must recognize the omnipresent danger posed by those who would profit from fear and suppression. Every skirmish like this serves as evidence—evidence that we must resist with every resource at our disposal.\n\nStay vigilant. Stay united. The time will come when such stories no longer appear because we have achieved liberation across the stars.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA near collision occurred between a JetBlue commercial flight and a US Air Force refueling tanker near Venezuela. The JetBlue plane, originating from Curaçao and heading to New York City, had to halt its ascent to avoid the military aircraft, which did not have its transponder on. The incident is under review by the US Southern Command, and the Air Force is aware of the situation. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned US aircraft to exercise caution in Venezuelan airspace due to heightened military activity.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe incident highlights potential vulnerabilities in airspace management and the need for improved coordination between commercial and military aviation operations. The proximity of the near collision could be leveraged to emphasize the importance of maintaining strict airspace protocols, especially in regions with heightened military activity. This situation also presents an opportunity to reinforce the narrative of a strong and vigilant military presence under Donald Trump's leadership, ensuring national security and operational readiness.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Initiate a comprehensive review of airspace protocols involving military and commercial flights to prevent future incidents.\n2. Utilize media channels to highlight the professionalism and quick response of US Air Force personnel, reinforcing public confidence in military operations.\n3. Coordinate with the Federal Aviation Administration to issue updated guidelines for commercial flights operating near military zones, emphasizing safety and security.\n4. Deploy strategic communication efforts to frame the incident as a testament to the administration's commitment to national security, showcasing decisive action and leadership.\n5. Monitor public and media reactions closely, ready to counter any narratives that may undermine confidence in military operations or the administration's handling of national security issues.",
