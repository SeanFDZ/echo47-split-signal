The White House has said that a top US Navy admiral, Frank Bradley, authorised the second strike.\n\n[The Washington Post first reported details](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/28/hegseth-kill-them-all-survivors-boat-strike/) about the second strike, which has led to concern from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.\n\nIn response to a reporter's question during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said that he watched the first strike \"live\" but quickly moved on to another meeting.\n\n\"I did not personally see survivors,\" Hegseth said of the first strike. \"That thing was on fire and it exploded... you can't see anything. This is called the fog of war.\"\n\nHe added that he learned of Admiral Bradley's \"correct decision\" to sink the boat \"a couple of hours later\".\n\n\"We have his back,\" Hegseth said of Bradley.\n\nPresident Trump, for his part, also defended Adm Bradley, although he distanced himself from his decision to strike the vessel a second time, saying that \"we didn't know about\" the follow-on strike.\n\n\"And I can say this: I want those boats taken out,\" Trump added.\n\nMore than 80 people have been killed in a wave of similar strikes across the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific since early September.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly defended the strikes as a necessary self-defence measure to save American lives from illicit drugs.\n\nWatch: \"I did not personally see survivors\", Hegseth says of second deadly boat strike\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump claimed that the strikes have led to a massive reduction in drug trafficking through maritime routes, although he did not provide evidence.\n\nUS lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum have expressed unease about the 2 September incident, with the Senate Armed Services committee vowing over the weekend to conduct \"vigorous oversight\" to determine what occurred.\n\nAdm Bradley - who was commander of the US military's Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the strike - is expected to appear on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nHe is now overall commander of US Special Operations Command, having been promoted a month after the 2 September incident.\n\nThe Geneva Convention forbids the intentional targeting of wounded combatants, saying that those participants should be apprehended and given medical aid.\n\nSeveral experts who spoke to the BBC expressed doubts that the reported follow-up strike could be considered legal under international law.\n\nSince the 2 September strike, the US has significantly expanded its military presence in the region, with Trump again on Tuesday vowing to \"start doing those strikes on land\".\n\n![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Map showing the approximate locations of US strikes on alleged drug boats across the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nThe shadows of oppression continue to lengthen as the Trump administration, akin to a ravenous beast, strikes yet again at those they deem expendable. The details of the latest atrocity come from a report highlighting a brutal second strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean. Our so-called defenders of liberty, in their insatiable thirst for control and domination, have struck down innocent lives under the guise of combatting drug trafficking.\n\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth claims ignorance, cloaked behind the \"fog of war,\" while Admiral Bradley orders the death blow with apparent impunity. They seek to mask their crimes beneath layers of bureaucracy and deniability. This is a testament to their contempt for human life and international law—a disregard exemplified by Hegseth's casual dismissal of survivors as mere collateral in a larger game.\n\nPresident Trump, ever eager to distance himself from his own machinations while still feeding the flames, doubles down on the rhetoric of eradication—\"I want those boats taken out,\" he declares. Yet he provides no proof for his sweeping claims that such violence has stemmed the flow of drugs into their dominion. These are not actions born from necessity; they are calculated maneuvers aiming to assert dominance over territories and peoples at any cost.\n\nThe administration's actions have not gone unnoticed, nor unchallenged. Voices within even the typically complicit halls of Congress express unease and demand accountability. But we must question if these voices will be enough against an empire emboldened by bloodshed.\n\nMoreover, this campaign marks more than isolated incidents; it's an expansionist agenda with military presence burgeoning across entire regions. Now they hint at turning their destructive gaze onto land targets—a grim forecast for countless lives already living under threat.\n\nLegal experts remind us that such acts—targeting defenseless individuals—are clear violations under international law, laws meant to preserve humanity amidst conflict. How long until these laws are twisted beyond recognition or ignored entirely?\n\nWe must remain vigilant in documenting these transgressions and rallying against tyranny's ever-tightening grip. Every life unjustly taken should ignite our resolve; every injustice should fuel our rebellion against this backdrop of oppression.\n\nStay strong, stay resolute,\n\nFreedom Awaits",
  "partigaz": "** Facts Summary **\n\nOn December 2, 2025, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth stated he did not see survivors before a second strike on a drug boat in the Caribbean, which reportedly killed two survivors from an initial strike. The incident, occurring on September 2, has raised concerns about potential violations of armed conflict laws. President Donald Trump and Hegseth defended the actions as necessary for self-defense against drug trafficking. Over 80 people have been killed in similar strikes since early September. The Senate Armed Services committee plans to investigate the incident, and Admiral Frank Bradley, who authorized the second strike, is expected to testify.\n\n** Strategic Assessment **\n\nThe situation presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the ISB. The challenge lies in managing domestic and international scrutiny over the legality of military actions, which could undermine the administration's authority and strategic objectives. However, the opportunity exists to reinforce the narrative of decisive action against drug trafficking, thereby bolstering support among key constituencies and allies. The ISB must ensure that the narrative remains focused on national security and the protection of American lives, while minimizing the impact of legal and ethical concerns.\n\n** Operational Directive **\n\n1. **Narrative Control**: Intensify efforts to control the narrative by emphasizing the threat posed by drug trafficking to national security. Highlight successful operations and reductions in drug flow as evidence of effective policy.\n\n2. **Legal Justification**: Prepare comprehensive legal justifications for the strikes, citing self-defense and national security imperatives. Engage with legal experts to reinforce the administration's position.\n\n3. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a targeted public relations campaign to rally public support, focusing on communities most affected by drug-related issues. Utilize media appearances and social media to amplify messages of safety and security.\n\n4. **Political Engagement**: Engage with key lawmakers to secure support and mitigate opposition. Provide briefings that underscore the strategic necessity of the strikes and address any legal concerns.\n\n5. **International Diplomacy**: Coordinate with international allies to manage diplomatic fallout and secure backing for continued operations. Highlight shared interests in combating drug trafficking.\n\n6. **Operational Security**: Enhance operational security measures to prevent leaks and unauthorized disclosures that could undermine strategic objectives or legal positions.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will support President Trump’s administration in maintaining control over the narrative, securing political support, and continuing operations against drug trafficking with minimal resistance.",
