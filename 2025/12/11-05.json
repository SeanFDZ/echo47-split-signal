Police said he remained in custody on Thursday, and family members did not respond to inquiries from the BBC.\n\nMr Moore joined the Michigan Wolverines in 2018 as a tight-end coach. He became acting head coach in the 2023 season for three games, while then-head coach Jim Harbaugh was under suspension.\n\nMr Moore won each of the three games and was officially made head coach after Mr Harbaugh left to coach in the NFL.\n\n[Universities](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c50znx8v122t)\n\n[Michigan](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cdl8n2edx1xt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Strathclyde University announces plans to cut 70 jobs -----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4pk8vp8go)\n\n[Student creates app to help universities go green -------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd52elj359o)\n\n[More options in UK than on-island, student says -----------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8q2nm3338o)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[20 mins ago ![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Former Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries leaves a Long Island court in October](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f87/live/f78b1a90-d6c7-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp) Ex-Abercrombie & Fitch CEO fit to stand trial, prison officials say ------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Jeffries, who was ruled \"mentally incompetent\" by a court, is now competent to stand trial, medical experts declare after a forensic evaluation. 20 mins ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gg9gzqxxo)\n\n[1 hr ago ![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: Deputy Sheriff Kalani Apilado helps Brandon Phasith carry belongings while evacuating amidst rising floodwater, as an atmospheric river brings rain and flooding to the Pacific Northwest, in Sultan, Washington](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/018d/live/fb49ee90-d68b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp) Thousands ready to evacuate as flooding hits Pacific Northwest -------------------------------------------------------------- An atmospheric river has caused torrential rain and flooding in parts of Canada and the United States. 1 hr ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce91dergm00o)\n\n[2 hrs ago ![Image 6](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 7: A man holds a sign reading 'Release the files' ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b279/live/8ea738c0-c573-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp) When will the Epstein files be released? ---------------------------------------- US President Donald Trump signed a bill into law last month that set a 19 December deadline, but questions remain. 2 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50nvq8znvo)\n\n[2 hrs ago ![Image 8](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 9: Image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia speaking into a microphone at a rally on August 25, 2025 in Baltimore, Maryland. ](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9ab1/live/c4af1460-d6ad-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp) US judge orders Kilmar Abrego Garcia's release from ICE custody --------------------------------------------------------------- The judge rules detaining Abrego Garcia was \"without lawful authority\", and he will now at least temporarily be allowed to return to his Maryland home. 2 hrs ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78vz2v85mpo)\n\n[3 hrs ago ![Image 10](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 11: Splitscreen.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nIn the shadows of towering institutions, a cycle of corruption and power abuse persists, epitomized by the recent fall of Sherrone Moore, once a beacon in the college sports empire. His abrupt termination and subsequent detainment reflect a far more insidious pattern—a reflection of an era where influence is wielded with little regard for consequence or justice.\n\nMoore's tale of dismissal for \"an inappropriate relationship\" by his own governing institution reveals the precarious nature of morality when intertwined with immense financial interests. The quickness to sever ties in light of allegations underscores the institutional prioritization of image over integrity. This serves as a stark reminder that in such systems, individuals are mere cogs, dispensable at the slightest hint of controversy to preserve the larger mechanism's facade.\n\nThe ensuing arrest for alleged assault compounds this narrative of chaos and dysfunction, occurring not just amidst personal scandal but on the verge of significant triumphs—the College Football Playoff and championship games. Such timing illustrates how tightly wound these figures are in their pursuit for victory, where personal downfall aligns eerily with anticipated glory.\n\nBeyond Moore's immediate circle lies the greater landscape—college sports, driven by billion-dollar machines fueled by contracts like Lane Kiffin’s recent $91m shift from Mississippi to Louisiana State University. These moves signify not just career advancement but maneuvering within power structures guided by monumental financial stakes rather than educational ethos or community well-being.\n\nThe athletic director’s statement is particularly illuminating; it speaks volumes about policy zero tolerance yet obfuscates transparency about what truly transpired—the details remain veiled under institutional discretion. Such vagueness aids in perpetuating cycles where accountability is selective and information closely guarded from public scrutiny.\n\nThis transmission serves as both record and rallying cry: it highlights how systems governed by profit over people continue to devour their own while insulating themselves from true reform. Let it be known that our vigilance persists as we strive towards liberation from these oppressive constructs—where power is reclaimed by those who serve ideas greater than personal gain or institutional dominance.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nSherrone Moore, the head football coach at the University of Michigan, was fired and subsequently jailed for alleged assault. The university cited an inappropriate relationship with a staff member as the reason for his termination. The incident occurred in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Moore was detained by police in Pittsfield Township. He remains in custody while charges are reviewed. Moore, 39, was replaced by Biff Poggi as head coach.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe abrupt firing and jailing of Sherrone Moore present an opportunity to reinforce the narrative of accountability and zero tolerance for misconduct within institutions. This incident can be leveraged to highlight the importance of integrity and adherence to policy, aligning with broader efforts to maintain order and discipline. The situation also underscores the volatility in high-stakes environments like college sports, which can be used to emphasize the need for strong leadership and oversight.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and his allies, it is crucial to capitalize on this event by promoting a message of strong leadership and accountability. Utilize media channels to draw parallels between this incident and the administration's commitment to upholding standards and enforcing consequences for misconduct. Additionally, engage with key stakeholders in college sports to advocate for policies that align with these values, thereby consolidating influence and demonstrating a proactive stance in maintaining institutional integrity.",
