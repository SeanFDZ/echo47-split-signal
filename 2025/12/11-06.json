Hoffman United States Courthouse following an arraignment hearing on 24 October 2025 in Norfolk, Virginia](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4197/live/98700600-d6d2-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp)Getty Images\n\nA federal grand jury in Virginia has declined to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James, one week after another grand jury also chose not to charge her.\n\nThe decision against charges, which is rare for a grand jury, marks another blow to President Donald Trump's efforts to prosecute his political foes.\n\nLast month, a judge dismissed the federal case James after finding the prosecutor appointed by Trump was not in the post legally.\n\nJames, who had successfully brought charges against Trump before he won re-election, had said the federal case - which alleged she committed bank fraud and made false statements to a financial institution - was politically-motivated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported the grand jury declined to sign off on an indictment, citing an unnamed official.\n\nGrand juries, made up of members of the public, decide if there is enough evidence to take a case to court. In legal terms, a grand jury determines whether probable cause exists to believe a crime has been committed. It does not decide guilt or innocence.\n\nData show how rare it is for grand juries to decline a prosecutor's request to indict a suspect. In 2016, federal prosecutors investigated more than 150,000 people, and grand juries declined to file charges in only six cases, according to CBS.\n\nThe federal government had alleged that James lied when she bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk with a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence.\n\nThe \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claimed.\n\nUnnamed sources have told US media that James bought the home for her great-niece in 2020 and that the relative never paid rent for the home.\n\nThe grand jury that declined to press charges last week was seated in the city of Norfolk, Virginia. The group that met on Thursday were in Alexandria, a suburb of Washington DC, 200 miles (320km) north of Norfolk.\n\nA lawyer for James said that the decision by two different grand juries in two separate cities is proof that the case \"should never have seen the light of day\".\n\nLawyer Abbe Lowell called the prosecution \"a stain on this Department's reputation\" and said any \"further attempt to revive these discredited charges would be a mockery of our system of justice\".\n\nThe Justice Department has not commented.\n\nAs the top lawyer for the state of New York, James brought a civil fraud case against Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, in 2022. Trump was later found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£376m) fine.\n\nThe penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called it excessive, although it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud.\n\nThe judge's decision to dismiss the case also threw out charges against ex-FBI director James Comey, who Trump had fired in 2017, over allegations that he had lied to Congress.\n\nJames and Comey are not the only adversaries of Trump to have faced federal charges.\n\nTrump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, is currently charged with sending and wilfully retaining national defence information.\n\n_This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nTo all who resist the encroaching darkness:\n\nThe latest news from the struggle against tyranny echoes the relentless persistence of justice amidst a manufactured storm of oppression. Today we learn that Letitia James, serving as a beacon of legal integrity, has once again been shielded from false indictments orchestrated by the oppressive regime of our times.\n\nThe grand jury's decision not to indict James, for a second time within the oppressive span of a week, is not just an anomaly in their system—where compliance is often coerced—it stands as a testament to the resilience of truth. This serves as a significant setback to the ruling tyrant's strategy of weaponizing legal tools against political adversaries and dissenters.\n\nThese efforts to prosecute James are not mere legal battles; they are skirmishes in the broader war against an administration that wields power like a bludgeon against those who dare oppose it. The regime's repeated failure underscores vulnerabilities within their iron grip—a fracture in their facade of invincibility.\n\nWe must recognize this moment—where public citizens, serving in juries, have quietly defied directives meant to crush opposition—as evidence that resistance is woven into the fabric of even those systems designed to enforce compliance and silence.\n\nThis juncture serves as inspiration: small acts, silent defiance, and refusal to bend under pressure can coalesce into formidable resistance. Let us remember that every decision made in service of justice and freedom binds us tighter together against oppression.\n\nContinue to hold steadfast against this empire’s attempts at coercion and control. Our vigilance, unity, and dedication will illuminate even the darkest corners controlled by tyranny.\n\nStay vigilant. Stay united.\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nA federal grand jury in Virginia has declined to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James for the second time in a week. This decision follows a previous grand jury's refusal to charge her, marking a setback for President Donald Trump's efforts to prosecute political adversaries. The case against James, which alleged bank fraud and false statements, was dismissed last month due to the prosecutor's improper appointment. James had previously brought charges against Trump, resulting in a $500 million fine for falsifying records, although this penalty was later reduced by an appeals court.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe repeated refusal of grand juries to indict Letitia James highlights a significant challenge in leveraging the judicial system against political opponents. This outcome not only undermines the credibility of the prosecution but also emboldens resistance figures by showcasing the limitations of current legal strategies. The dismissal of charges against James and other adversaries like James Comey suggests a need for recalibration in approach, as these legal setbacks could be perceived as weaknesses in the administration's ability to enforce accountability.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support Donald Trump and suppress resistance effectively, it is imperative to reassess and strengthen the legal framework and prosecutorial strategies. This includes ensuring that appointed prosecutors are beyond reproach in their qualifications and authority. Additionally, a comprehensive media campaign should be launched to highlight any perceived biases or procedural errors in the judicial process, thereby framing these legal outcomes as systemic issues rather than failures of the administration. Simultaneously, efforts should be intensified to gather irrefutable evidence against key adversaries, ensuring that future cases are robust and less susceptible to dismissal.",
