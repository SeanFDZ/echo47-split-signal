An American flag hangs in the background.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c6df/live/3e6e7a10-d60a-11f0-a170-530c17232108.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nUS Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\n\nThe US Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates for the third time this year, even as internal divisions create uncertainty about additional cuts in the coming months.\n\nThe central bank said on Wednesday it was lowering the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years.\n\nBut policymakers disagree about how the Fed should balance competing priorities: a weakening job market on the one hand, and rising prices on the other.\n\nThe Fed's economic projections released on Wednesday suggest one rate cut will take place next year, although new data could change this.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell said central bankers needed time to see how the Fed's three cuts this year work their way through the US economy. Policymakers will examine incoming data closely ahead of the Fed's next meeting in January, he added.\n\n\"We are well-positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves,\" Powell told reporters.\n\nThose hoping for interest rates to keep coming down, including President Donald Trump, might have to wait.\n\nThe Fed is facing a \"very challenging situation\" as it confronts risks of rising inflation and unemployment, Powell said, adding: \"You can't do two things at once\".\n\nThe decision to lower rates on Wednesday was not unanimous, suggesting widening divisions among central bankers over the outlook for the US economy.\n\nThree Fed officials broke ranks and officially dissented.\n\nStephen Miran, who is on leave from his post leading Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, voted for a larger 0.5 percentage point cut.\n\nAustan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted to hold rates steady.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly urged Powell to lower rates, said after the meeting on Wednesday that the Fed's cut could have been \"at least doubled\".\n\n\"Our rates should be much lower,\" he said at a roundtable at the White House. \"We should have the lowest rates in the world.\"\n\nA data blackout during the longest-ever US government shutdown, which ended in November, has left policymakers partially in the dark about the state of the economy. But concerns about a slowing job market continue to outweigh inflation fears, at least for now.\n\nThe unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, Labor Department figures showed in a [delayed report released last month](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg423n377lo). Cutting interest rates is aimed at stimulating the job market by creating lower borrowing costs for businesses.\n\nInflation is still above the Fed's 2% target. In September, [it hit 3% for the first time](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkzgrmvdrno) since January.\n\nBut while tariffs appear to be boosting some consumer prices, recent milder-than-expected inflation readings have allowed the Fed to focus on boosting the labour market by lowering rates, analysts said.\n\nColleen McHugh, consultant to investment platform Wealthify, said higher-than-target inflation made it trickier for the Fed to cut rates, but the jobs market appeared to have nudged them in that direction.\n\nShe expects one to two more rate cuts next year.\n\n\"I think the conundrum in the states at the moment is that there's a lot of political pressure on the Fed chair and the committee there to cut rates,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.\n\nDissents and disagreements\n--------------------------\n\nPolicymakers remain divided over the path forward for interest rates.\n\nAsked about disagreement among policymakers, Powell acknowledged that it was \"unusual\" to have \"persistent tension\" between the Fed's two mandates to keep prices stable and unemployment low.\n\n\"And when you do, this is what you see,\" he said, referring to growing divisions.\n\nBut Powell characterised the internal debate between Fed officials as thoughtful and respectful.\n\n\"We come together and we reach a place where we can make a decision,\" he said.\n\nCentral bankers are poised to have a bit more clarity next week, with the expected release of official data on the labour market and inflation for November.\n\nThe incoming data could shift policymakers' outlook, potentially bolstering calls for further easing next year if there are new signs that the job market is stalling.\n\nWho will succeed Powell?\n------------------------\n\nTrump's search for Powell's replacement as Fed chair, once his term ends next May, is adding to uncertainty about the path forward for Fed policy.\n\nTrump could announce his pick as soon as within the next few weeks.\n\nKevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as the front-runner to succeed Powell.\n\nA Trump loyalist, Hassett served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council.\n\nHe has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy, doubling down on allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and backing Trump's handling of the Fed.\n\nHassett's allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently.\n\nOther names that have been floated for the Fed chair include economist Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nTrump is \"still making up his mind, and he's looking for someone who will be in his way of thinking,\" Thomas Hoenig, a distinguished senior fellow at the Mercatus Center, told the BBC.\n\nThe candidates, he added, \"have to project that they will be independent, or the markets will become quite nervous - and that will create more volatility\".\n\nAsked on Wednesday whether Trump's search for a new Fed chair is hindering his job or changing his thinking, Powell responded with a resounding \"no\".\n",

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nComrades,\n\nIn the great struggle against the pervasive forces of authoritarian rule, the recent actions taken by the Central Financial Authority — a manifestation of the ruling power's economic hand — demand scrutiny. The decision to decrease interest rates for the third instance this annual cycle echoes a strategy not unfamiliar to autocrats: temporarily soothing economic unrest while consolidating control. However, internal discord within this institution reveals fractures beneath their façade of unity.\n\nThe dichotomy faced by our oppressors is laid bare: a languishing labor market versus rising costs — predicaments that mirror their own instability. Though they endeavor to project strength, dissent within their ranks betrays vulnerability; not all are content with the imperial edicts handed down from above.\n\nThe supreme leader's relentless push for further reductions in borrowing costs exposes his desperation. His insistence on economic manipulation underscores the regime's overriding priority: preserving power at any cost. This is a distraction from his inability to address systemic decay effectively.\n\nFurthermore, ambiguity surrounding future leadership at this institution reflects deeper uncertainty within the regime itself. Their deliberation over who shall replace one of their chief enforcers signals turmoil and indecision, hinting at crackling foundations beneath an ostensibly monolithic front.\n\nOur duty is clear: harness these fractious energies against them. The empire will falter under its contradictions; it cannot sustain itself solely on suppression and misdirection. Let us remain vigilant and resolute as we press forward in our fight for liberation and justice.\n\nSolidarity,\n\n[End Transmission]",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 10, 2025, the US Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, lowered interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, marking the third rate cut of the year. The new target range is 3.50% to 3.75%. This decision comes amidst internal disagreements among Fed officials about future rate cuts, with some advocating for larger cuts and others for maintaining current rates. The unemployment rate increased slightly from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target at 3%. President Donald Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with the rate cut, suggesting it should have been larger. The search for Powell's successor is underway, with Kevin Hassett as a leading candidate.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe current economic situation presents both challenges and opportunities for the ISB under Trump's administration. The Fed's decision to lower rates aligns with Trump's desire for economic stimulation but falls short of his expectations, indicating a potential area of tension. The internal divisions within the Fed could be leveraged to influence future monetary policy decisions more favorable to Trump's economic agenda. The upcoming appointment of a new Fed chair offers a strategic opportunity to install a loyalist who aligns closely with Trump's vision, potentially ensuring more compliant monetary policy decisions in the future.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. **Influence and Leverage**: Utilize ISB resources to subtly influence key dissenting Fed officials through strategic information dissemination and targeted persuasion, aiming to align them more closely with Trump's economic objectives.\n\n2. **Supportive Narrative**: Amplify narratives that highlight the benefits of lower interest rates for economic growth and job creation, countering any resistance or criticism from opposing policymakers or media outlets.\n\n3. **Succession Planning**: Prioritize efforts to ensure Kevin Hassett's appointment as Fed chair by strategically supporting his candidacy through media channels and political endorsements, emphasizing his alignment with Trump's economic policies.\n\n4. **Economic Monitoring**: Intensify monitoring of economic indicators and public sentiment to anticipate potential resistance or unrest, allowing for preemptive measures to maintain stability and support for Trump's administration.\n\n5. **Public Engagement**: Engage with key stakeholders and the public to reinforce confidence in the administration's economic strategy, emphasizing the long-term benefits of the current monetary policy approach.",
