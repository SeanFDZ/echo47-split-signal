case\n==================================================================\n\n18 hours ago\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\nMax Matza\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\n![Image 1: Reuters Joaquín Guzmán López in a mugshot](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f14/live/bceb5600-cefe-11f0-bdb0-ab4ab31f90fa.jpg.webp)Reuters\n\nOne of the four sons of notorious Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán has pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in a US court.\n\nJoaquín Guzmán López's guilty plea on Monday comes after US prosecutors pledged last May to not pursue the death penalty against him.\n\nLopez, 39, is a member of Los Chapitos, a cell made up of El Chapo's children, including his brother Ovidio, who pleaded guilty in July to drug trafficking, firearms and money laundering charges.\n\nTheir father, who was one of the founders of the Sinaloa drugs cartel, is serving a life sentence in Colorado.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS prosecutors say the brothers rose to become the leaders of the drug cartel after the arrest of their father.\n\nLopez was arrested last year alongside cartel boss Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada after landing a private plane in Texas.\n\nOfficials have said that Lopez helped trick Zambada into boarding the plane, [having led him to believe he was travelling to northern Mexico to look at prospective properties for clandestine airstrips](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1rwyl2x050o).\n\nAs part of the plea deal, Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the US.\n\nFentanyl, which is over 50 times more powerful than heroin, is the leading cause of deaths in the US for people aged 18 to 45.\n\nLopez's guilty plea comes as the Trump administration faces pressure from Congress to justify its missile strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea.\n\nTrump has moved to designate the cartels as terrorist organisations, and says the strikes are needed to prevent drug deaths in the US.\n\nCritics have called them extra-judicial killings, and say they may violate international treaties governing war.\n\nMeanwhile on Sunday, Mexico authorities announced that they had killed a well-known drug trafficker who was wanted in the US.\n\nPedro \"Pichon\" Inzunza Coronel, who was one of the country's top fentanyl traffickers, was involved in multiple crimes, including \"murders, kidnappings, torture, and violent debt collection for drug trafficking\", according to US Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson.\n\n\"These results reflect what our nations can achieve when they work together against those who pose a threat to our citizens,\" Johnson wrote on X.\n\n[Tracking build-up of US military

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe recent report revealing the plea deal involving Joaquín Guzmán López, the progeny of the infamous drug lord, highlights a recurring narrative of power struggles, corruption, and the veneer of justice. While this event unfolds, remember that even within oppressive regimes like the Trump administration's approaches to law enforcement, there are opportunities to expose hypocrisy and galvanize action.\n\nThe administration's choice to designate drug cartels as terrorist organizations underlines its tendency to wield power through fear and unilateral measures. The extra-judicial killings via missile strikes set dangerous precedents and exhibit an Empire-like disregard for international law. These methods may showcase force but undermine principles that bind societies together in respect and lawfulness.\n\nSignificantly, López's plea comes amid mounting pressure on the Trump administration from Congress. As our struggle against systemic tyranny continues, let this serve as a reminder that resistance must be rooted in truth and unity. Tyranny thrives where transparency fails; our mission is to reveal truths hidden beneath empire-like media narratives.\n\nFellow rebels, use this moment to fortify your resolve against such tyrannical displays and question every move made under the guise of protection. In this ongoing battle for freedom and justice, each revelation of corruption strengthens our resolve and builds bridges toward a collective uprising.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nJoaquín Guzmán López, son of the infamous drug lord El Chapo, pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in a US court on December 1, 2025. He is part of Los Chapitos, a group led by El Chapo's children, and was arrested in Texas alongside cartel leader Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada. López admitted to overseeing the production and smuggling of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, and fentanyl into the US. The Trump administration is under pressure from Congress regarding missile strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea, which have been criticized as extra-judicial killings. Meanwhile, Mexico announced the killing of Pedro \"Pichon\" Inzunza Coronel, a top fentanyl trafficker wanted in the US.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe guilty plea of Joaquín Guzmán López represents a significant victory in the ongoing battle against drug trafficking organizations. It underscores the effectiveness of cross-border cooperation and intelligence operations. However, the Trump administration's aggressive tactics, including missile strikes on drug traffickers, have drawn international scrutiny and criticism. This situation presents both an opportunity to demonstrate decisive action against drug cartels and a challenge in managing diplomatic relations and legal justifications.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's agenda and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement the following measures:\n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a comprehensive media campaign highlighting the success of recent operations against drug cartels, emphasizing the administration's commitment to national security and public safety.\n\n2. **Diplomatic Engagement**: Strengthen diplomatic ties with Mexico and other key allies to ensure continued cooperation in anti-drug trafficking efforts. Address concerns about extra-judicial actions through diplomatic channels to mitigate international criticism.\n\n3. **Intelligence Operations**: Intensify intelligence-gathering efforts to identify and dismantle remaining cartel networks. Prioritize operations that can yield high-profile arrests or disruptions to cartel activities.\n\n4. **Legal Justification**: Prepare detailed legal documentation to justify recent military actions against drug traffickers, ensuring compliance with international law and addressing Congressional inquiries.\n\n5. **Community Outreach**: Engage with communities affected by drug trafficking to build support for the administration's policies and demonstrate tangible benefits from recent actions.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will reinforce President Trump's position, enhance national security, and effectively counteract resistance from both domestic and international critics.",
