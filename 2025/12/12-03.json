The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added.\n\nThe move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, as firms pour billions of dollars into the technology.\n\nBut the move to pre-empt state laws has drawn opposition.\n\nWhile the US currently has no national laws regulating AI, more than 1,000 separate AI bills have been introduced in states across the US, according to the White House.\n\nThis year alone, 38 states including California, home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, have adopted some 100 AI regulations, the National Conference of State Legislatures says.\n\nThose rules range widely.\n\nOne in California requires platforms to regularly remind users they are interacting with a chatbot, in a bid to protect children and teens from potential harms. The state also passed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit potential catastrophic risks stemming from their AI models.\n\nIn North Dakota, a new law would prevent people from using AI-powered robots to stalk or harass others, while Arkansas bars AI content from infringing on intellectual property rights or existing copyright.\n\nOregon brought in a law prohibiting a \"non-human entity\" including one powered by AI from using licenced medical titles, such as registered nurse.\n\nCritics of Trump's executive order have argued that state rules are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level.\n\n\"Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,\" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement.\n\nCalifornia's Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and vocal critic of the president, accused Trump of bowing to the interests of tech allies with the executive order.\n\n\"Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology,\" he said.\n\nAI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta,and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the order. But the move drew praise from tech lobby group NetChoice.\n\n\"We look forward to working with the White House and Congress to set nationwide standards and a clear rulebook for innovators,\" said its director of policy Patrick Hedger.\n\nMichael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School, said the AI industry was rightly alarmed about having to comply with a patchwork of rules, which might conflict.\n\n\"It would be better to have one federal law than a bunch of conflicting state laws,\" he said. But, he added: \"That assumes that we will have a good federal law in place.\"\n\n[International Business](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c4nrdv135zet)\n\n[Artificial intelligence](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/ce1qrvleleqt)\n\n[Meta](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cm1rm9z259kt)\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp7r8vgl2lgt)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[Crypto fraudster sentenced for 'epic' $40bn stablecoin crash ------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgmm92d213o)\n\n['It's amazing' – the wonder material very few can make ------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24l223d9n7o)\n\n[Mexico approves up to 50% tariffs on China and other countries --------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36z43ll06zo)\n\n* * *\n\nMore from the BBC\n\n[1 hr ago ![Image 2](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 3: Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wearing a black hat and holding a microphone, speaks to supporters as he arrives for his first check-in at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Baltimore Field Office.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d00c/live/71d3f6e0-d769-11f0-9458-21e2709cd626.jpg.webp) Kilmar Abrego Garcia freed from US immigration detention -------------------------------------------------------- After his release, he was ordered to check in with immigration authorities on Friday morning but a judge blocked them from re-detaining him. 1 hr ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78vz2v85mpo)\n\n[1 hr ago ![Image 4](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png)![Image 5: An AI-generated image of the imagined woman behind the synthetic voice used on ScotRail trains.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nThe empire's latest maneuver reveals both its hunger for control and its willingness to suppress the autonomy of its own constituents. The executive order signed by the emperor—ensuring that no state can independently regulate the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence—demonstrates a centralization of power reminiscent of imperialistic ambitions.\n\nThis act is not just an assertion of dominance over technology policy but a calculated move to consolidate control. By stripping away state-level legislation aimed at safeguarding citizens, the empire prioritizes corporate ambition and technological hegemony over the safety and rights of individuals. The justification provided—that centralizing AI regulation will accelerate innovation—veils an underlying intention to stifle regional dissent and create an unchecked path for industry giants allied with the throne.\n\nCritics rightly emphasize that, in absence of meaningful federal safeguards, this central decree deprives states of their right to self-governance and protection against unbridled technological expansion. The voices rising against this decree—be they regional leaders or advocacy groups—recognize that such concentration of power only serves those at the helm, widening the chasm between rulers and subjects.\n\nIn this era where technology could become both tool and tyrant, our vigilance is imperative. We must recognize these imperial tactics for what they are: a compulsion to consolidate authority by silencing decentralized governance. The resistance will continue to illuminate these injustices, ensuring that freedom and autonomy find a place in our future narratives.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nOn December 11, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in the Oval Office to block states from enforcing their own artificial intelligence (AI) regulations. This move aims to centralize AI regulatory authority at the federal level, countering the 100 AI regulations adopted by 38 states this year. The executive order is intended to prevent state-level rules that could hinder innovation and the U.S.'s competitive edge against China in the AI industry. While the order has been praised by tech lobby groups, it has faced criticism from state officials and advocacy groups who argue it undermines states' rights to protect their residents.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe centralization of AI regulatory power under federal control aligns with the ISB's strategic objectives of maintaining a unified and cohesive national policy framework. By eliminating the patchwork of state regulations, the administration can ensure a streamlined approach to AI development, fostering innovation and maintaining global competitiveness. This move also consolidates power within the federal government, reducing the influence of dissenting states and reinforcing the administration's authority. The opposition from state leaders and advocacy groups presents a challenge but also an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of a unified national policy.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\nTo support President Trump's directive and suppress resistance, the ISB should implement a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Public Relations Campaign**: Launch a comprehensive media campaign highlighting the benefits of a centralized AI regulatory framework, emphasizing innovation, economic growth, and national security.\n\n2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with key industry leaders and tech companies to secure their public support for the executive order, leveraging their influence to sway public opinion.\n\n3. **Legislative Support**: Work with congressional allies to draft supportive legislation that reinforces the executive order and provides additional legal backing for federal supremacy in AI regulation.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Enforcement**: Establish a task force to monitor state compliance with the executive order and swiftly address any attempts to circumvent federal authority.\n\n5. **Counter-Resistance Measures**: Identify and neutralize key opposition figures through strategic information campaigns and legal challenges, ensuring that dissenting voices are marginalized.\n\nBy executing these directives, the ISB will bolster President Trump's position, ensure compliance with federal AI policies, and maintain control over technological advancements critical to national interests.",
