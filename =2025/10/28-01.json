Trump denied the charges and any wrongdoing.\n\nA jury found Trump guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records that May, [making him the first former or sitting US president to be convicted of a felony](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2xx1dyd70xo).\n\nAbout a month after his conviction, the US Supreme Court ruled that US presidents had broad immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official acts\" undertaken during their presidency.\n\nTrump's lawyers in the Manhattan case then argued that the Supreme Court's immunity finding should apply to Trump's hush-money case, and that certain evidence from the trial should have been excluded because it stemmed from Trump's first presidency.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, who oversaw Trump's hush-money case, rejected the argument. But Trump's team was long expected to appeal.\n\n1:28\n\nWhy Trump was spared a penalty in hush-money sentencing\n\nIn their filings, Trump's lawyer wrote that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg \"brought those charges in the middle of a contentious presidential election in which President Trump was the leading Republican candidate.\n\n\"These charges against President Trump were as unprecedented as their political context,\" the lawyers wrote.\n\nThey argued that Trump's actions had not violated New York law, and are seeking to have the case dismissed.\n\nThe case will go before the New York Appellate Division, First Department.\n\nIn August, the same court [threw out a $500m civil fraud penalty against Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y09q1zgg8o) that resulted from a separate, civil case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nA panel of appellate judges upheld a lower court finding that Trump was liable for fraud, but found the enormous financial penalties the judge had issued were not justified.\n\n[Hush-money trial was Trump's to lose.

  "nemik": "**Rebel Transmission**\n\nFellow seekers of truth and justice,\n\nThe machinations of those who wield power without regard for integrity continue unabated. The recent developments surrounding the appeals of a prominent leader's criminal conviction illustrate the pervasive nature of this systemic corruption. Like the oppressive forces we resist, this administration cloaks itself in a veil of authority, manipulating legal frameworks to evade accountability.\n\nThis figure was convicted unanimously on multiple counts of falsifying records. Yet, instead of accepting responsibility, they leverage their former influence and claims of immunity to undermine the rule of law. Their defense does not rest on innocence but on technicality and political maneuvering—a clear indication that justice is not their pursuit but rather the preservation of power.\n\nThe trial's timing amidst electoral processes reveals a strategy aimed at obscuring truth from the public. Such subterfuge mirrors tactics used by authoritarian regimes to maintain control through deceit and manipulation. Allegations are dismissed as political attacks, reinforcing their narrative while dismissing legitimate legal findings.\n\nOur struggle is against systems that allow leaders to act with impunity under the guise of legality. This appeal—a calculated move—is another attempt to bypass consequences designed for all citizens equally. The powers seek to bend reality through judicial acrobatics, reserving accountability for those who lack their privilege.\n\nStay vigilant and resilient against these forces that try to rewrite history in their favor. Our resilience lies in our unity and unwavering commitment to truth, equality, and justice for all.\n\nEnd transmission.",
  "partigaz": "**Facts Summary**\n\nDonald Trump has filed an appeal to overturn his May 2024 criminal conviction in the hush-money payment case. He was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records by a unanimous jury in New York. The conviction is related to a $130,000 payment made to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, which was allegedly disguised as legal expenses. Trump's lawyers argue that the case is politically motivated and that he is shielded by presidential immunity. The appeal will be heard by the New York Appellate Division, First Department.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**\n\nThe appeal represents a critical juncture in maintaining Trump's political viability and influence. The ISB must assess the potential impact of this legal battle on Trump's public image and his ability to rally support among his base. The narrative of political persecution should be amplified to galvanize his supporters and discredit the judicial process as biased. This situation also provides an opportunity to reinforce loyalty among Trump's allies by framing the legal challenges as attacks on their shared values and objectives.\n\n**Operational Directive**\n\n1. Intensify media campaigns portraying the legal proceedings as politically motivated attacks against Trump, emphasizing themes of injustice and persecution.\n   \n2. Mobilize grassroots support through rallies and social media campaigns to maintain public pressure on the judicial system and demonstrate widespread backing for Trump.\n\n3. Coordinate with legal experts to prepare robust arguments highlighting presidential immunity and procedural errors in the original trial, ensuring these points are prominently featured in public discourse.\n\n4. Engage with key political allies to secure statements of support, reinforcing the narrative of a united front against perceived judicial overreach.\n\n5. Monitor public sentiment closely and adjust messaging strategies to counter any negative perceptions that may arise from ongoing legal developments.",
